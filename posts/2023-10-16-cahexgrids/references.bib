               foundation for global land use land cover (LULC) mapping with
               unprecedented detail at 10 m resolution. We present a
               cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google's Dynamic
               World (DW), ESA's World Cover (WC) and Esri's Land Cover (Esri)
               products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and
               application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the
               three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e.,
               near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop
               LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased
               towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and
               scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground
               truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m2, we found that
               Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75\%) compared to DW
               (72\%) and WC (65\%). Across all global maps, water was the most
               accurately mapped class (92\%), followed by built area (83\%),
               tree cover (81\%) and crops (78\%), particularly in biomes
