495630,10030,Hexanchus griseus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (<em>Hexanchus griseus</em>)&#160;is a large (to 550 cm total length) deep-water shark known with a global yet patchy distribution. It occurs in tropical, temperate and boreal&#160;waters off continental slopes and shelves, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly at depths of 200–1,100 m.&#160;It has large litters but an estimated late age-at-maturity that reduces its capacity to recover from fishing pressure. The species is infrequently caught incidentally in deep-water industrial and artisanal&#160; fisheries across its range.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range and increases in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.&#160;The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (160 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p><strong><br/></strong>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is&#160;demersal in tropical, temperate and boreal waters on the slope, shelf, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly 200–1,100 m&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Griffing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weigmann 2016).&#160;It also occurs on seamounts and mid-ocean ridges and is often associated areas of high biological productivity and upwelling (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 550 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016); males mature at ~309–330 cm TL and females mature at 350–420 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Reproduction is aplacental viviparous&#160;with litter sizes of 47–108, and size-at-birth is estimated at 61–74 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013)<a>. Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 26.5 years and maximum age is estimated at 80 years (COSEWIC 2007), resulting in a generation length of 53 years. This study has not been validated and estimates should be used with caution.&#160;</a></span></p>","<p>The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is infrequently reported as targeted and incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, longline, handline, traps, and gillnet fisheries across its range (e.g. Celona <em>et al</em>. 2005, White and Dharmadi 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The species is also targeted by recreational fishers (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Post-release mortality for the species is likely to be low (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017), and the species is mostly discarded (Silva and Ellis 2019). <br/><br/>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl and longline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with medium risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and relative biomass in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (160 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis of the CPUE and relative abundance estimates from the Northeast Atlantic over 21 years between 1998–2018 (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.4%, consistent with an estimated increase of 80.4% over three generation lengths (160 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the past three generation lengths. <br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, video surveillance and dive encounter rates in the Strait of Georgia showed large declines in sightings between 1999–2005 (COSEWIC 2007). A decline is sightings were also reported from Elliott Bay, Puget Sound between 2003–2005 and 2008–2015 (Griffing <em>et al. 2</em>019). However, these observed declines are not thought to be representative of true reduction in population and may be attributed to environmental or behavioural factors, or natural variability of juvenile recruitment (COSEWIC 2007, Griffing <em>et al</em>. 2019). Genetic studies in Puget Sound suggest the local stock is fairly large (Larson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), but there is apparent cohort-specific, broad variation in abundance (Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, the species was targeted in the deep-water fisheries in the Maldives before stocks collapsed and were replaced with a fishery for gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp) (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). The gulper shark fishery also collapsed over a short period of time (20 years) (Ali 2015); while there are no data available, the rapid decline of the gulper shark fishery may be indicative of the duration of the former targeted fishery for the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark prior to the collapse of stocks. <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, abundance indices from CPUE data of the species landed at Cilacap-Central Java and Tanjung Luar, Indonesia show no trends between 2014–2018, but only a small number of individuals were caught&#160;(Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>The species is infrequently reported across much of its range including past and/or present targeted shark fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018), the Mediterranean (Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), east and west Africa (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), Indonesia (Blaber<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009,&#160;White and Dharmadi 2010),&#160;and Australia (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001,&#160;Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;It is likely to have some refuge at depth in parts of its range. Based on documented declines in part of its range (Maldives) and increasing trends in others (Northeast Atlantic), overlap with fishing pressure and refuge at depth, a global population reduction of 20–29% was estimated over three generation lengths (160 years). Therefore, the Bluntnose Sixgill&#160;Shark&#160;is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, distribution across all oceans&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).<p><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p>","<p>The species is utilized for its meat, liver oil, cartilage, and fish meal (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Akhilesh and Ganga&#160;2013). In the early 20th century, the species was also utilized for its leather (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Given its large size, its meat, fins, and liver oil can fetch high market prices in some places (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). Its fins have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p><br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005. <br/><br/>The Maldives has a general ban on shark fishing since 1998 which affords this deep-sea species protection from fisheries exploitation within that range (<a>Ali</a>&#160;2015). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range. In Canada, the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is listed as a species of Special Concern under the&#160;Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2009 and by&#160;the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2007 and a management plan under SARA was developed to ensure the recovery and conservation of the species (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012).&#160;Further research is needed on population size and trends of the species, and catches should be monitored.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

As in other guitarfishes, reproduction is aplacental viviparous and females give birth to live young (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Female age-at-maturity is about 8.5 years and longevity is 11 years (Caltabellota <em>et al.</em> 2019, F. Caltabellota pers. comm. 2019), and therefore generation length is estimated at 9.75 years.","The Chola Guitarfish is targeted and/or caught as bycatch in commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its range. Gears include demersal trawls, beach seines, gillnets, and trammel nets. These fisheries are unmanaged thoughout its range, and in some areas are intense. For example, in Colombia, this species is among the most commonly caught in both artisanal and commercial fisheries (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2007, Grijalba-Bendeck <em>et al.</em> 2007). In northern Brazil, several elasmobranchs have been reduced alarmingly by overfishing (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). Some parts of its range are likely to be suffering from habitat degradation due to coastal development and pollution (Gonçalves-Silva and Vianna 2018).","There are no range-wide estimates of population size or trend. The level of intense and unmanaged fishing pressure on the Caribbean coast of Central and South America leads to suspicion of steep population reduction. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas.&#160;In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia unpubl. data 2018) at the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery.&#160;In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza, 2015).&#160;Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2001). Despite some area closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there as a result of dwindling catches (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016, Santana <em>et al. </em>2020). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;In Brazil, there are no data for this species, however, the closely-related Brazilian Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos horkelii) </em>has suffered severe population depletion (&gt;80% between 1986–2001) from overfishing there, and it is suspected that this species has fared similarly. Overall, due to the level of unmanaged and intense fishing pressure across its range, the near-disappearance of other elasmobranchs including similar species, and coastal habitat degradation, it is suspected that the Chola Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (about 30 years), and these pressures show no sign of abating in the near future.",Decreasing,"The Chola Guitarfish occurs patchily in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from Quintana Roo, Mexico to <span class=""st"">Paraná, Brazil (Schmitter-Soto <em>et al</em>. 2000, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).

It inhabits continental shelves from inshore to depths of 181 m. It is captured using artisanal longlines, gillnets, beach seines, and in industrial shrimp  trawls. This species is inferred to be stable or increasing in the Western Central Atlantic, based on its similarity to the&#160;Bullnose Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis freminvillei</em>). In the Southwest Atlantic artisanal fisheries are intense, further there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas.&#160;In Brazil, landings of eagle rays have been reduced by 60% over 2000–2012 in Santa Catarina State, and a reduction of 91% in Rio Grande do Sul since the 1980s. This inshore eagle ray has no refuge at depth&#160;and is exposed to intense and often unmanaged fishing pressure throughout the Atlantic South American portion of its range and there it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (44 years), but is stable in the Western Central Atlantic. Overall, based its range with the almost all threats found in the Southwest Atlantic, the suspected low productivity of the species, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Southern Eagle Ray inhabits continental shelves from inshore to 181 m depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 115 cm disc width (DW) (Araújo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); males mature at ~45–55 cm DW and females mature at ~70 cm DW. Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a litter size of six pups (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is estimated to be 14.5 years based on data for the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>),  which has an age-at-maturity of five years and a maximum age of 24  years (Martin and Cailliet 1988), although this may be an overestimation  as that species has a larger maximum size.","The Southern Eagle Ray is captured using artisanal longlines, gillnets, beach seines, and industrial shrimp trawls (Velasco <em>et al. </em>2011, Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2016). There are no known threats in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic but in the Southwest Atlantic artisanal fisheries are intense. Further, there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;This species is caught in gillnets and less frequently in trawls (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2019). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo<em> et al. </em>2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). Gillnets are prevalent and target elasmobranchs (Chiaramonte 1998, Tamini <em>et al. </em>2006, Colautti <em>et al. </em>2010), and this is one of the most valued species in Buenos Aires Province (J-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018). This inshore eagle ray is exposed to intense and often unmanaged fishing pressure throughout the Atlantic South American portion of its range, and it has no refuge at depth.","This species is inferred to be stable or increasing in the Western Central Atlantic, based on its similarity to the Bullnose Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis freminvilli</em>).&#160;In Atlantic South America, there are very few time-series of abundance. In Venezuela there are no data, but this species is captured in large numbers in artisanal fisheries there, which lack management. The situation is suspected to be similar in the Guianas, but there are no data. In northwestern Brazil, fishing pressure is intense and other elasmobranchs have been depleted there, and it is suspected that these fisheries are leading to a reduction in population size in that area. This species is also caught in large numbers in the intense artisanal gillnet, beach seine, and trawl fisheries further south in Brazil, and declines have been reported in Paraná&#160;and Rio Grande do Sul&#160;states&#160;(Araújo&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018). Landings of eagle rays, in general, declined in Santa Catarina state by&#160;60% since the 1980s&#160;(R. Baretto unpubl. data 2018) and declined by&#160;91% in research trawls between 1974–2005 (Ferreira&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), equivalent to a &gt;85% reduction for this species if scaled over three generation lengths (44 years). In Uruguay, <em>Myliobatis</em> species are not exploited by industrial fishing. Eagle rays are generally discarded in artisanal fisheries (or only retained for the fisherman's own consumption) (Silveira <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Uruguayan time series of abundance from spring research cruises between 1984–1995 catches were between 1–3 t, and since 1996 have varied between 0.02 and 0.7 t (L. Paesch unpubl. data 2020, indicating a reduction of equivalent to a &gt;75% reduction for this species if scaled over three generation lengths (44 years). In Argentina, there have been declines reported in eagle rays since the 1980s (Ruocco 2012). Overall, based on its range with the almost all threats found in the Southwest Atlantic, the suspected low productivity of the species, this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in three generation lengths (44 years). Therefore, the Southern Eagle Ray is assessed as Vulnerable (A2d).<br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><p><span class=""st""></p></span>",Decreasing,"The Southern Eagle Ray occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans in South Carolina and Florida, USA and from Quintana Roo, Mexico to San Jorge Gulf, Santa Cruz, Argentina (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

890724,161564,Carcharhinus altimus,Near Threatened,A2d,2020,2020-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bignose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus altimus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 300 cm total length) shark  that is patchily distributed in warm temperate and tropical waters worldwide. It inhabits continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 0–810 m, with young mostly inshore and adults offshore close to the seafloor during the day and near the surface at night. The species is taken as bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with pelagic longline and purse seine, trawl, and gillnet, and is retained for the meat and fins. The population declined significantly over 30 years where it was previously targeted in the Maldives, prior to closure of the fishery in 2010. The population is suspected to have declined by 20–29% in the Northwest Atlantic and by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas over three generation lengths (60 years) due to fishing pressure. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific data however it is subject to intense and  unregulated fishing pressure across approximately half of its range and has a low  biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries. There is lesser fishing pressure in the other half of its range where  there are managed fisheries. It is suspected that the Bignose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2d.","The Bignose Shark occurs in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves and upper continental slopes at depths of 0–810 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). The young tend to occur in shallow waters to depths of 25 m while the adults are more common offshore in deeper waters; they are found close to the seafloor during the day and often diurnally migrate to the surface at night (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Last and Stevens 2009, Henderson and Reeve 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, White<em> et al. </em>2017). It reaches a maximum size of 300 cm total length (TL), males mature at 190 cm TL and females mature at 205 cm TL (Crow <em>et al.</em> 1996, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 3–15, a biennial reproductive cycle and size at birth of 60–90 cm (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Preliminary verified age parameters indicate female age-at-maturity of 17 years and maximum age of 23 years; generation length is therefore 20 years (Jensen <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The Bignose Shark is caught globally as mostly bycatch in pelagic longline and purse seine, gillnet, and bottom trawl fisheries and generally retained for the meat and fins (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). Its migratory behaviour from the seafloor to shallow waters at night increases its susceptibility to capture in the widespread pelagic tuna fisheries. Commercial at-vessel-mortality in pelagic longline fisheries is highly variable ranging from 0–60% (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). Under-reporting of this species is also likely due to misidentification as the Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>).<br/><br/> In the United States (US) pelagic longline fishery (east coast of the US, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean), this species represented 5.3% of the catch from 1987–2010 based on fisher logbook data (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2018).  It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT  longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility  (Arrizabalaga <em>et al. </em>2011), However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with no reported captures from 2010–2017 (ICCAT 2018). It was taken in directed artisanal fisheries in the Central Mexican Pacific during the mid-1990s (Pérez-Jiménez e<em>t al. </em>2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, off Brazil, the Bignose Shark&#160;is taken  incidentally by commercial fisheries on the outer continental shelf and  continental slope. The species was first identified and recorded from  the catches of tuna longliners operating out of Santos (São Paulo State,  southern Brazil) by Sadowsky and Amorim (1977). It is seldom caught by  this fleet but retained when caught and sold as ""other sharks"" (Arfelli  and Amorim 1994). This species was also taken in directed artisanal shark  longline fisheries around the Venezuelan oceanic islands in 1997–1998 (Tavares 2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/> In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the  pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005). In West African waters, the Bignose Shark is infrequently caught (Diop  and Dossa 2011). In South Africa, it has been only reported as captured  in the bather protection programme (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>The Bignose Shark&#160;is taken in tuna fisheries and bottom trawls in the  Western Indian Ocean and probably by line or gillnet off India; there  are only isolated reports of its occurrence in Indian waters and in the  Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) longline fisheries where it is rarely reported (Kizhakudan <em>et al. </em>2015, IOTC 2018, E. Romanov pers. comm.&#160;09/02/2017). It was taken by nearshore pelagic longline around the Maldives where catch rates were reported by fishermen to have declined significantly (C.  Anderson pers. comm. 25/05/2007);<strong> </strong>however, shark fishing in the Maldives has been banned since 2010. Whole  individuals are consumed and traded at local markets in the Philippines  (SEAFDEC 2006). In  Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught occasionally by shark longline, gillnet, and coastal fishers (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>It is taken in the Western Central Pacific Ocean in  longline and purse seine gears but only in low numbers of &lt; 5  individuals per purse seine set and mostly &lt;5 individuals per 1,000  longline hooks (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). It is infrequently  captured in beach meshing programs in Australia, accounting for &lt;0.1%  of the total shark catch from 1962–2017 (Roff<em> et al. </em>2018). It has also been reported in low numbers from the West Australian Pilbara Fish Trawl Fishery (McAuley <em>et al. </em>2005).","There are no robust species-specific time series available for this species. It was targeted in a pelagic longline fishery in the Maldives and was considered relatively common in the 1970s and 1980s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Sattar <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, catch rates reported by fishermen declined significantly in the years leading up to 2007 followed by the closure of the fishery in 2010 (C. Anderson, pers. comm. 25/07/2007, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic, although there were no species-specific data, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over three generation lengths (60 years) due to longline fisheries (Pillans <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (60 years) due to its large size, valuable fins, susceptibility to fisheries, and intensive fisheries (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort in some areas leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan and Yemen were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002). Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016), likely as a result of dramatic increases in fishing pressure. The number of trawlers  operating in the Indian state of Gujarat (one of the major shark catching regions) has almost doubled between 2000 and 2010 from ~6,600 to 11,582 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004, CMFRI 2010). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, catches of sharks are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to maintain catches (Chen 1996). For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to  waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T.  White, pers. comm. 25/08/2007). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Bignose Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Overall, due to documented declines where it was previously targeted, intense and unregulated fishing pressure across approximately half of&#160; its range along with low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries, balanced with lesser fishing pressure in the  other half of its range where there are managed fisheries, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).",Decreasing,"The Bignose Shark has a circumglobal but patchy distribution (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Duffy and Struthers 2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2017).","The species is used for its meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and cartilage; the fins of adults are large and of high-value (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Last and Stevens 2009, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018).",Marine,"In United States waters, the Bignose Shark has been a prohibited species, at least  since 2007 and is now prohibited under the Consolidated Atlantic Highly  Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (NMFS 2007, NOAA 2014). Targeted shark fishing has been banned in the Maldives Exclusive Economic Zone since 2010.  Globally, there are no international catch limits in place for Bignose Sharks. To prevent future overfishing, it is recommended that Bignose Sharks be subject  to regional and national catch limits based on scientific advice and/or  the precautionary approach, as well as improved reporting of catch and  discard data, and efforts to minimize bycatch mortality. Further research is needed on population size and trends, and life history.","",,false,false,Global

This is a poorly-known skate that inhabits upper continental slopes at depths of 311–940 m, possibly to 1,900 m. While it is a potential bycatch of demersal trawl and benthic longline fisheries in parts of its range, its wide depth range provides it with an extensive refuge as there is a general lack of deepwater fisheries in the Western Central Atlantic.

However, it is a possible bycatch of the royal red shrimp trawl fishery that operates at depths of 250–550 m in the US Gulf of Mexico and off the Atlantic coast to North Crarolina (Stiles <em>et al. </em>2007, Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2015). Trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds with only a small number of vessels operating in the fishery (Stiles <em>et al. </em>2007). Observer coverage has also been low and little information is available on bycatch (Scott-Denton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012)&#160;.</p><p>Commercial shark and reef fish benthic longline fisheries operate in the US Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast&#160;from Texas to North Carolina at depths of 3–355 m (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;In the Gulf of Mexico, skates were reported in the shark target fishery (2–227 m) between Louisiana and Florida, and the reef fish fishery (29–355 m) between Texas and Florida (Gulak and Carlson 2013). In the southwest US, skates were only reported as bycatch in the large coastal shark target fishery at depths of 3–30 m (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In all cases, they&#160;made up less than 2% of catch, and the majority were discarded alive (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Gulak and Carlson 2013).</p>                  <p><a name=""_Hlk17411565"">Fisheries in the region generally do not extend to the depth range of this species, and there is a lack of deepwater fisheries in the region (Brooks&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).

Similar depths are likely fished elsewhere in the Caribbean for deepsea snapper.&#160;</a>Specialized deepsea shark fishing has developed locally in some areas, for example in Martinique, which shows the potential for expansion of deepsea shark fishing. In the case of Martinique, several deepsea species were protected by government decree after the development of the fishery, effectively ending the targeting of deepsea sharks (Prefecture de la Martinique Arrete No. R02-2019-04-25-003).</p>  <p>Deepsea fishing has not yet developed in the Colombian Caribbean, however, there is increasing interest in developing a fishery at depths of 200–550 m for deepwater cardinalfish (<em>Epigonus</em> spp.) which are targeted by trawl and longline in other ocean regions (e.g. Australasia and the Northeast Atlantic) (Paramo 2011, Paramo <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/></p><p>There is potential for this species to be taken as bycatch in Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and French Guiana where there are deepwater bottom longline snapper and grouper fisheries operating on the outer continental shelf and upper slope (Mendoza <em>et al.</em> 2003). In Venezuela, there are three deepsea fisheries in operation. The first is on the central coast which has a very narrow continental shelf, and where for the last 20 years there have been at least two main deepsea fishery landing sites with varying number of boats operating longline, seines, and traps at depths of 200–800 m, 4–6 days a week. These fisheries target demersal and pelagic bony fishes. The second deepsea fishery has been operating off northeast Venezuela on the continental slope of Margarita and La Blanquilla Islands at depths ranging from 200–600 m for the past 12–15 years, 5 days a week. Demersal shark and ray species are not targeted but are encountered as bycatch. Finally, the third deepsea fishery operates on a smaller scale with gillnets and longlines in eastern Venezuela on the Paria Peninsula shelf near Trinidad and Tobago with fewer than 30 boats which are used for a variety of activities including fishing. This is the most recent deepsea fishery to develop and has only been operational for the past 5 years. Demersal fish and chondrichthyans are caught, most predominantly <em>Mustelus</em> spp. and<em> Squatina </em>spp. (O.

Development of four main fisheries (hook and line, benthic gillnet, pot, and benthic trawl) was intense; the entire area fished for deepwater shrimp species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three year period (2003–2006) (Dallagnolo <em>et al. </em>2009). For the most part, deepwater fishing is concentrated in the southeast and southern parts of Brazil, with only 4.1% of deepwater hauls occurring in the northern and northeast areas, predominantly by trawl (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009, Port <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Therefore, there is nothing to infer or suspect population reduction at this time and the species is assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The Rough Pygmy Skate is demersal on soft substrate of continental and insular slopes at depths of 251–1,007 m (McEachran and de Carvalho 2002, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches 51 cm total length (TL); males mature at 39 cm TL and the smallest known juvenile specimen is 9 cm TL (McEachran and de Carvalho 2002, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is presumably oviparous, like other skates, but nothing else is known of its biology.</p>","<p>There is no specific information available on bycatch of this species. However, it is a possible bycatch of the Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>) trawl fishery that operates at depths of 250–550 m in the US Gulf of Mexico and off the Atlantic coast to North Carolina (Stiles <em>et al. </em>2007, Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2015). Trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds with only a small number of vessels operating in the fishery (Stiles <em>et al.</em> 2007). Observer coverage has also been low and so little information is available on bycatch (Scott-Denton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).</p>  Commercial shark and reef fish benthic longline fisheries operate in the US Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast&#160;from Texas to North Carolina at depths of 3–355 m (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;In the Gulf of Mexico, skates were reported in the shark target fishery (2–227 m) between Louisiana and Florida, and the reef fish fishery (29–355 m) between Texas and Florida (Gulak and Carlson 2013). In the southeast US, skates were only reported as bycatch in the large coastal shark target fishery at depths of 3–30 m (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In all cases, they&#160;made up less than 2% of catch, and the majority were discarded alive (Gulak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Gulak and Carlson 2013).<br/><p>Deepsea fishing has not yet developed in the Colombian Caribbean, however there is increasing interest in developing a fishery at depths of 200–550 m for deepwater cardinalfish (<em>Epigonus</em> spp.) which are targeted by trawl and longline in other ocean regions (e.g. Australasia and the Northeast Atlantic) (Paramo 2011, Paramo <em>et al.</em> 2017). The development of any deepwater fishery should be monitored, as this species may be susceptible to being caught as bycatch in such a fishery.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk17411565"">Fisheries off the Caribbean Islands generally do not extend to the depth range of this species, and there is a lack of deepwater fisheries in the region (Brooks&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Off Barbados, pot and line fisheries for crab and snapper (<em>Lutjanus</em> spp.) will set as deep as ~275 m (N. Simpson unpubl. data 2019) and in the Dutch Caribbean to depths of &gt;300 m for deepsea snapper (T. Bervoets pers. comm. 24/6/2019). Similar depths are likely fished elsewhere in the Caribbean for deepsea snapper.&#160;</a>Specialized deepsea shark fishing has developed locally in some areas, for example in Martinique, which shows the potential for expansion of deepsea fishing. In the case of Martinique, several deepsea species were protected by government decree after the development of the fishery, effectively ending the targeting of deepsea sharks (Prefecture de la Martinique Arrete No. R02-2019-04-25-003).</p><p>There is potential for this species to be taken as bycatch in Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and French Guiana where there are deepwater bottom longline snapper and grouper fisheries operating on the outer continental shelf and upper slope (Mendoza<em> et al.</em> 2003).&#160;In Venezuela, there are three deepsea fisheries in operation. The first deepsea fishery is on the central coast which has a very narrow continental shelf, and where for the last 20 years there have been at least two main deepsea fishery landing sites with varying number of boats operating longline, seines, and traps at depths of 200–800 m, 4–6 days a week. These fisheries target demersal and pelagic bony fishes.&#160;The second deepsea fishery has been operating off northeast Venezuela on the continental slope of Margarita and La Blanquilla Islands at depths ranging from 200–600 m for the past 12–15 years, 5 days a week. Demersal shark and ray species are not targeted but are encountered as bycatch.&#160;Finally, the third deepsea fishery operates on a smaller scale with gillnets and longlines in eastern Venezuela on the Paria Peninsula shelf near Trinidad and Tobago with fewer than 30 boats which are used for a variety of activities including fishing. This is the most recent deepsea fishery to develop and has only been operational for the past 5 years. Demersal fish and chondrichthyans are caught, most predominantly <em>Mustelus</em> and <em>Squatina</em> spp. (O. Lasso-Alcalá unpubl. data 2019).</p>                  <p>Deepwater fishing off the Atlantic coast of Brazil was initiated in 1973 as a handline fishery for Atlantic Wreckfish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>) on the upper slope (Perez <em>et al. </em>2003). However, industrial deepwater fisheries did not emerge until the early 2000s at which point unprecedented commercial exploration began on fishing grounds 200<em>–</em>1,000 m deep (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009, Pio <em>et al. </em>2016). Development of four main fisheries (hook and line, benthic gillnet, pot, and benthic trawl) was intense; the entire area fished for deepwater shrimp species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three year period (2003–2006) (Dallagnolo <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;For the most part, deepwater fishing is concentrated in the southeast and southern parts of Brazil, with only 4.1% of deepwater hauls occurring in the northern and northeast areas, predominantly by trawl (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009, Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Deepwater trawl fishing in the northern and northeast parts of the country were abandoned shortly after the first attempts in 2002 and there are currently limited deepwater fisheries in these regions.&#160;Along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil, skates are potential bycatch in a bottom gillnet fishery operating on the upper slope (200–500 m depth). In 2002, international fleets were prohibited from the fishery and only a small fleet of no more than 5 licensed national units were then in operation, although current fishing levels are unknown (Perez and Wahrlich 2005, Perez <em>et al. </em>2009). Trawl fisheries operating on the outer shelf, and the upper to mid slope covering depths of 100–1,173 m have greatly expanded since 2000. While the foreign vessel-chartering program operating predominantly between 100–400 m and 700–750 m off the southern and southeast coasts of Brazil declined in 2007 due to poor catch rates, national expansion of slope trawling continued uncontrolled from 2003 to 2011 (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009, Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Brazil, nearly all trawl bycatch is discarded, and the most common elasmobranchs in discards were Blackbelly Lanternshark (<em>Etmopterus lucifer</em>) and the Onefin Skate (<em>Gurgesiella dorsalifera</em>) (Perez<em> et al</em>. 2013).</p>  Outside of Brazil and possibly Venezuela, the bulk of the species’ range is suspected to be&#160;unfished.","<p>Population trend is unknown for the Rough Pygmy Skate, although it is suspected to be stable based on its wide depth distribution and the levels of fishing effort within its range.&#160;</p>",Stable,"<p>The Rough Pygmy Skate occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Florida, USA to Brazil, including Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (McEachran and de Carvalho 2002, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>",<p>There are no data available on use and trade; skates are generally not utilized in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico due to a lack of deepwater fisheries.</p>,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for the Rough Pygmy Skate.

It is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves at depths of 0–200 m. The low biological productivity combined with its schooling behaviour and tendency to occur in inshore waters make it susceptible to fishing pressure, although if the pressure is on the juveniles only, it can be sustainable.  The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and  recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl,  longline, and gillnets. Over the past three generation lengths (38 years), the population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic in response to management measures and to have undergone a minor reduction of 3% in South Africa. It is suspected to have declined by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (38 years) and is inferred to have also declined in the Mexican Atlantic, Southwest Indian Ocean, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. In Australia, it is captured in low numbers in managed fisheries and likely to be sustainably fished. The Spinner Shark has low biological productivity and although there is  less fishing pressure and managed fisheries in some parts of its range, most of its range occurs in areas of intensive and unregulated  fisheries. It is suspected  that the Spinner Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%  over the past three generation lengths (38–59 years) due to  exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Spinner Shark is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental and insular shelves at depths of 0–200 m (Weigmann 2016). It  is a highly migratory species that occurs more frequently in inshore rather than offshore waters and has nursery grounds in shallow, near-shore waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is often found in schools that may include large numbers of individuals. It reaches a maximum size of 304 cm total length (Weigmann 2016), males mature at 170–220 cm TL and females mature at 160–222 cm TL with regional variation in these parameters; smaller sizes-at-maturity are noted for the North Atlantic and Arabian Seas and the larger sizes-at-maturity for Australia, Taiwan, and South Africa  (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002, Joung <em>et al. </em>2005, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Geraghty <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 3–15, a biennial reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 48–80 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Joung <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Australia, verified female age-at-maturity is 8.5 years and maximum  age is 31 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.8 years (Geraghty <em>et al. </em> 2013, Geraghty <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the Gulf of Mexico, verified female  age-at-maturity is 7.6 years with a maximum age of 17.5 years, resulting in a  generation length of 12.6 years (Carlson and Baremore 2005). These Gulf of Mexico ages are  similar to estimated ages in a previous Gulf of Mexico study and to ages  estimated from South Africa (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002).","The Spinner Shark is caught globally as target and retained bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl, longline, and gillnet (Joung <em>et al. </em>2005, McVean <em>et al.</em> 2006, Carlson and Bethea 2007, Geraghty <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jabado<em> et al. </em>2015, Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2017). It is also taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). Under-reporting of the Spinner Shark is likely due to misidentification with the Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Tillett <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).  At-vessel mortality (AVM) was estimated as 56% in a commercial prawn trawl fishery and 4–97% in commercial longline fisheries (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). The longer soak times in the longline fisheries had a much higher AVM (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/> <br/> In the Northwest Atlantic, the species is among a range of carcharhinids targeted by the commercial fishery along the southeast coast to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a common component of the commercial catch in the north-central  Gulf of Mexico, but is less often caught in the fisheries along the  eastern seaboard of the United States. It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility (Arrizabalaga <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with only 3 reported captures from 2010 to 2017 (ICCAT 2018).&#160;  <p>In the Mexican Atlantic, the Spinner Shark accounts for a small proportion of the total shark catch in the small-scale fishery catches. The small-scale fisheries in Mexico account for 97% of the country’s marine fleet and take most of the Mexican shark catch, which is substantial and places Mexico among the top 10 global shark catching countries (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Oakes and Sant 2019). Spinner Shark represented 0.1–1.4% of the shark catch over three separate studies from 1993 to 2014, with the number of individuals captured in those studies varying from 808 in 1993–1994, to 30 in 2007–2010, and 37 in 2011–2014 (Castillo-Géniz et al. 1998, Castillo-Géniz 2001, Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2020). The species was reported as seasonally common in the early years of the fishery during 1980–1998 (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al. </em>2020).  Fishing effort on sharks peaked in 1980–1998 but a 35% reduction in  shark catches from 1999 to 2008 led to a reduction in the shark fishing  fleet and effort (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas  <em>et al.</em> 2020). It has been recorded as a small portion of small-scale fisheries catches in the Guatemala Caribbean (Hacohen-Domené <em>et al. </em>2020).</p>  In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2005). In West Africa, the demand for shark fin in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, Set0 <em>et al.</em> 2017, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2019). Spinner Shark are among the reported shark catches of West Africa, with the species among those caught in the highest numbers in Guinea-Bissau (Diop and Dossa 2011). By 2010, there were an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels (that mostly take shark as bycatch) operating in West Africa (Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the Arabian Seas region, fisheries have experienced increased demand  for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result,  effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas and likely has increased fishing pressure on this species  (Bonfil 2003, Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;  <p>In South Africa, the Spinner Shark is caught incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, prawn trawl fisheries, and the beach protection program. The estimated average annual catch was 1–10 t from 2010 to 2012 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Mozambique and Madagascar, mostly unregulated small-scale fisheries that target sharks, including the Spinner Shark, are intense with 45,805 and 78,787 vessels, respectively operating in these countries in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p><p>  In Southeast Asia, the catches of this species vary spatially and temporally across the region. It was among the top 10 species landed at some major fishing ports, such as Cilicap, Indonesia and infrequently recorded elsewhere (SEAFDEC 2016). In Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught by longline, with juveniles a common catch of inshore gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, White <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). It was one of the most abundant species landed in eastern Indonesia from 2001 to 2006 (White 2007). The extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are also an indirect threat to coastal and inshore habitats of this species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/></p>In Australia, the Spinner shark is caught in low levels as bycatch in Western Australian trawl fisheries, the Northern Prawn Fishery, and the Eastern Tuna and Billfish longline fishery (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is also taken in east coast line fisheries, although it is frequently misidentified as either the Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C. tilstoni</em>) or the Common Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Tillet <em>et al. </em>2012). In southeast Queensland, approximately 30% of the total catch is the Spinner Shark, all specimens of which were less than one year old (Gutteridge 2012). While this catch is considerable, the life history of the Spinner Shark indicates that it can sustain high levels of fishing mortality in the juvenile age classes as part of a gauntlet fishery, that is, a fishery that only catches sub-adults and minimizes mortality on the breeding stock (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020). Therefore, this level of fishing effort in southeast Queensland is suspected to be sustainable. However, heavy fishing pressure on the adult stock is suspected to lead to population declines (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020).","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) relative abundance in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (Peterson <em>et al. </em>2017) and (2) catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in South Africa (M. Dicken pers. comm. 1/04/2019). The trend data from each source  were analyzed over three generation lengths (38 years) using a Bayesian  state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields  an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths,  and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent  change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). </p>    <p>First, the abundance index in the Northwest and Central West Atlantic derived from fishery-independent surveys with trawl, longline, and gillnet showed an increase in relative abundance from the late 1990s to 2014. This has been associated with the enactment of the shark Fishery Management Plan in 1993 and is indicative of recovery of the Spinner Shark in the region (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2017). It aligns with an earlier noted increase in relative abundance of 14% for the Spinner Shark in the commercial bottom longline fishery from 1994 to 2009 (Carlson <em>et al. </em>2012). The trend analysis of the Northwest and Central West  Atlantic relative biomass for 1996–2014 (19 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 8.5%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (38 years), with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths.<br/></p><p>  </p><p>Second, the South Africa nominal CPUE from the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program fluctuated but was considered stable from 1978 to 2019 (M. Dicken pers. comm. 01/04/2019). The trend analysis of  this CPUE for 1978–2019 (42 years) revealed annual  rates of reduction of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated median  reduction of 3.0% over three generation lengths (38 years), with the  highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>In the Mexican Atlantic, Spinner Shark were reported as being commonly seasonally caught in the earlier years of the fishery (1980–1998), followed by a decrease in catches likely as a result of intense fishing pressure (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020). Due to the intense effort in the early years of the fishery and low biological productivity, the Spinner Shark is considered highly vulnerable to the Mexican shark fisheries (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020).  </p><p>    </p><p></p>In the Arabian Seas region, the Spinner Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (38 years) due to its large size, valuable fins, susceptibility to fisheries, and intensive fisheries (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort in some areas as well as a reduction in the number of shark catches, which suggests population declines have occurred (Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example,&#160;in Eritrea&#160;catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 with a concurrent reduction in the CPUE of all sharks of ~66% (Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, and Yemen were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002). In Pakistan, catches of Spinner Shark have declined by 40–50% over the past 20 years due mainly to a large fleet that targets demersal fishes (M. Khan, pers. comm. 3 June 2020).<br/>  <p>In the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), including Mozambique and Madagascar, small-scale fisheries are intense with elasmobranch landings increasing nine-fold from 1970 to 2013 and the Spinner Shark reported among the catches, although there are no species-specific trends and no SWIO-wide concurrent effort data (Temple<em> et al.</em> 2018). Depletion of inshore shark stocks across the SWIO region may be occurring as small-scale shark fishers have shifted towards fishing further offshore (Temple <em>et al.</em>  2018). In Madagascar, reconstructed shark catches indicate dramatic  declines since the mid–1990s despite increases in estimated fishing  pressure with these large declines also evidenced by diminishing returns  for shark fishers (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Cripps <em>et al. </em>2015, Temple <em>et al. </em>2018).  In Mozambique, catches of small-scale fisheries, which account for 90%  of the total catches and include targeted shark catches, have  declined considerably in recent years, mainly due to overfishing and  illegal fishing (Benkenstein <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016), likely as a result of increased fishing pressure. The number of trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat (one of the major shark catching regions) has almost doubled between 2000 and 2010 from ~ 6,600–11,582 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004, CMFRI 2010).<br/><br/>In West Africa, all elasmobranchs are considered either fully exploited or overexploited due to intense and unregulated artisanal and industrial fishing pressure that includes targeted shark fishing, and the highest level globally of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Diop and Dossa 2011, Doumbouya<em> et al.</em> 2017, R.W. Jabado, pers. comm. 4 April 2020). The reconstructed industrial and artisanal fishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for all fishes across the region has declined by 30% since 1950, driven by a strong decline in artisanal CPUE (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Mauritania, overfishing of sharks is reported, likely driven by the strong interest in the shark fin fishery from the 1980s onwards (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Senegal, recent stock assessments reveal heavy over-exploitation of coastal demersal fish stocks (Ba <em>et al. </em>2018), and although there is no information on shark stocks, they are highly likely to be captured in these coastal fisheries and thus also likely subject to heavy exploitation levels. In Gambia, declines in shark fisheries have been reported from 2001 to 2011 with a recent study of an intensive shallow water demersal fishery reporting a dominance of batoids and the absence or rarity of previously common inshore elasmobranchs that raise concerns that some elasmobranchs have been severely depleted (Moore <em>et al. </em>2019).  <p> In Southeast Asia, catches of many shark species are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers. comm. 25/8/2007). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Spinner Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). <br/></p><p>In Australia,  the standardized CPUE for catches of all whaler sharks (26 species which includes Spinner Shark) in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has declined by 82% from 1962 to 2017 (Roff<em> et al. </em>2018). This represents a reduction of 84% when scaled to three generation lengths of Spinner Shark (59 years). The QSCP data is not species-specific, rather it is informative for understanding the potential levels of decline for the species in the region. Spinner Shark accounted for 2.3% of the total catch, with species identification reliable only from ~1996 onwards and it is unknown whether the decline in whaler shark catch rates represents an even decline across the 26 whaler species or a shift in species composition (Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, the effects of fishing on the Spinner Shark are limited, that is, in commercial fisheries in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, as most of the fishing effort is focused on the juvenile age classes and the species is estimated to be sustainably fished.</p><p>     </p>  <p>The Spinner Shark population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, to have undergone a reduction of 3% in South Africa over the past three generation lengths (38 years), and to be sustainably fished in most of Australia. The increase in population is indicative of a recovery in response to management measures. In the Arabian Seas region, there are documented declines where it was previously targeted and is subject to intense and unregulated fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone a &gt;30% reduction over the past three generation lengths (38 years). Elsewhere, declines are suspected based on depletions of inshore shark stocks, declines in general shark catches, and overfishing of sharks.<strong> </strong>The Spinner Shark has low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries, and  although there is lesser fishing pressure in some parts of its range  where there are managed fisheries, most of its range occurs in areas of  intensive and unregulated fisheries. Overall, it is suspected that this  species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past  three generation lengths (38–59 years).<strong></strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p><strong>  </strong><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Spinner Shark occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and the Indo-West Pacific Oceans; it has not been recorded from the Northeast, Eastern Central, and Southeast Pacific Oceans&#160;(Ebert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>","The species is used for the meat, fins, liver oil, skin, and cartilage (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The meat is valuable and sold both fresh domestically and dried and exported. Spinner Shark fins accounted for 1.2% of fin samples in Hong Kong and 7.9% of the fins traded from United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Hong Kong; as UAE is a trading hub, the fins could have been sourced from across the Arabian Seas region and eastern Africa (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 8/4/2020).",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for Spinner Shark.

The population trend was inferred from a fishery-independent trawl survey of the American Cownose Ray from the&#160;Gulf of Mexico&#160;which reveals the population increased through 1987–2010 but has been declining ever since, yet the overall estimated annual rate of increase is 2.5%, and a high probability of Least Concern (83%). In the Southwest Atlantic, however, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other species, and this species has disappeared from southern Brazil due to intense demersal trawl and beach seine fisheries from southern Brazil. In Venezuela, there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings.&#160;Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (43 years). Given the Southwest Atlantic occupies approximately one-half of the global range, that the species has extremely low biological productivity, and that it is also likely to be subject to undocumented fisheries in Central America, it is suspected that the Brazilian Cownose Ray has undergone a global population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths&#160;(43 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Brazilian Cownose Ray is a benthopelagic ray that occurs inshore over sandy bottoms, from nearshore to 20 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;This is considered a summer immigrant in southern Brazil following warmer water masses coming from the north of Brazil and reaching the shallow nearshore beaches along the state of Rio Grande do Sul between December to February which may be a nursery area for Brazilian Cownose Ray<em>&#160;</em>(G. Rincon pers. comm. 23/08/2020). The species reaches a maximum size of at least 104 cm disc width (DW); males and females mature at ~78 cm DW; 38–48 cm DW at birth (Last<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016). There is no habitat use or ecology information available for Brazilian Cownose Ray. However, it was inferred that Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;should be similar in life history to American Cownose Ray and thus assumed to have low productivity. Generation&#160;length was estimated as 14.3 years based on an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","In the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, the Brazilian Cownose Ray has been reported only from the Gulf of Mexico and assumed to have the same threats as American Cownose Ray, which is primarily taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls (J.K. Calson unpubl. data 2019). In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America along with largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are  widespread  and lack management and there is also a shallow-water  shrimp trawl  fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla  and A. Navia  unpubl. data 2018). This species is targeted there along  with other cownose and eagle rays. In Venezuela, commercial and  artisanal fisheries are  intense and lack management. Further, these fisheries have  exhibited peaks in catches  followed by declines, which is indicative of  sequential overfishing (Mendoza  2015). Groundfish  fisheries on the  Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000; these  fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with vessels  crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015). In northwestern  Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high  and 44% of target stocks  were likely to be overfished by the end of the  2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are   intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there   report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been   depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016).   In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a   period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over  650  vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).   Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted   by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed   (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species has no geographic   refuge from fishing within its range in Atlantic South America and does   not have refuge at depth.","In the Northwest Atlantic, genetic analysis of mitochondrial genes were used to confirm the presence of Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico. Both American and Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;overlap geographically to a large degree in the southern Gulf of Mexico (Palacios-Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2017). As there is no species-specific trend data available for this species in the northwest Atlantic, trend information for American Cownose Ray was inferred to represent Brazilian Cownose Ray. In the Gulf of Mexico, the relative abundance time-series based on analysis of a fishery-independent trawl survey from 1986 to 2018 (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) shows a steady increase in catch rate of American Cownose Ray to a peak around 2010, followed by a steady decline to the end of the time-series. Overall, abundance&#160;increased at an annual rate of change of +2.5%, but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened (NT = 3%, VU = 6%, EN = 7%, and CR = 1%, see Supplementary Information for&#160;<em><a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/60128/3088381"">Rhinoptera bonasus</a></em>).&#160;<br/><br/>In  Caribbean Colombia, there are no time-series of abundance but this  species is targeted in intense gillnet fisheries that are likely causing  a reduction in the population size there. <span class=""st"">In Venezuela, declines in the abundance of rays  including this species were reported as far back as the early 1970s  (Ginés <em>et al. </em>1972, cited in Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2012). There are unmanaged artisanal  gillnet fisheries that continue to capture species with broadly similar catchability (e.g. Whitespotted Eagle Ray<em> </em>(<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>)) (Tagliafico<em> et al.</em>  2012), and there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of <em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>, but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings&#160;(Tagliafico and Rago 2009).<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Data  are sparse in the Guianas, but it is suspected  that there have been  reductions in the population there as a result of  the level of  artisanal and commercial fishing pressure. <span class=""st"">There are no   data from northern Brazil, but commercial and artisanal fisheries are   intense, unmanaged, and have led to worrying declines in other species,   and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been   reduced in numbers in that area. In the southernmost 700 km of its distribution, off Rio Grande do Sul, the species occurred as a summer migrant in coastal waters where it was caught and discarded in large numbers during the 1980s by the summer beach seine fishery, with catches of up to 330 individuals in a single haul. Fishing with demersal trawl and paired-trawls has been intense in this southern area from the 1980s onwards, although the effort of the beach seine fishery is now minor due to serious catch declines.&#160;In summer 2002–3, during three months of surveying of the shore-based fishery, the species was no longer caught.<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> <br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">It is suspected that the species has been eliminated by intensive fishing in the restricted area of its southern summer habitat and/or by fishing further north in the area from which the summer migrants come from (C.M.

Specifically,&#160;Vooren <em>et al.</em> (2005) report artisanal captures using beach seine nets of 1,711 discarded specimens on 14th January 1985. This fishery targeted teleost fishes in depths less than 10 meters towards the beach where the nets were hauled. Subsequently, according to these authors, the species was not recorded in the same fishery in 2003 or by the gill net fishery in 2005, and after 62 scientific trawls in 2005 only one neonate was captured (G.

This listing is based on an estimated further 80% of the remaining population in a 21-year window between 2002–2023. While at least two extant subpopulations have been discovered in Costa Rica and the species has been recorded recently in Panama, there is currently insufficient data to conclude that declines have abated.","It is a terrestrial species of humid lowland and montane forest; specimens recorded at lowland rainforest localities were all found along high-gradient, rocky streams, in hilly areas (Savage 2002). It is associated with small fast-flowing streams and is often found along the banks and sitting out on rocks in streams; at night they sleep in crevices or low vegetation. However, the subpopulation in&#160;Alexander Skutch Biological Corridor&#160;behaves radically different and is seen less often on the splash zone of the river and more often on exposed&#160;vegetation&#160;1–6 m above the water, where there is more solar radiation (Jímenez <em>et al.</em> 2019). This basking behaviour might be significant for two reasons: 1) it could&#160;explain why this species has been hard to locate in the area, as researchers may focus solely on crevices, rocks, and roots as reported by most of the literature (<em>e.g</em>.,&#160;Pounds and Crump 1994); and 2) as&#160;temperature (Woodhams <em>et al.</em> 2003) and moisture (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2003) have been suggested as two important environmental factors influencing the growth and survival of <em>Bd,&#160;</em>short periods of high body temperature&#160;could have helped&#160;reduce the risk of exposure to&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;infection&#160;(Woodhams<em> et al. </em>2003, Jímenez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>This species formerly occurred in large concentrations during the dry season, from December to May (Savage 2002).

Pollution from mine runoff and domestic and agricultural waste is also a threat to some parts of its Panamanian range (R. Ibáñez pers. comm. March 2016, B. Gratwicke pers. comm. February 2017), and it is part of the international pet trade although it is not known how this affects the wild subpopulations of this species.</span></span></span></span></span></span>","This species was formerly quite common in Costa Rica, and&#160;at one point there were over 100 known subpopulations in both the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of the mountain ranges in Costa Rica and western&#160;Panama (Savage 2002).&#160;Drastic declines were first recorded in Monteverde in 1988,&#160;followed by extirpation from the surrounding Tilarán Mountains between 1990 and 1992 (Pounds and Crump 1994),&#160;and the species was thought to have been extirpated in the country by 1996, largely due to chytridiomycosis&#160;caused by the&#160;chytrid&#160;fungus, <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> (<em>Bd; </em>Lips<em>&#160;</em>et al. 2003). However, in 2003, a remnant subpopulation was discovered at Fila Chonta, Quepos, on the Pacific coastal range. Surveys in 2005, however, revealed no additional individuals (Ryan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Monitoring at this site has documented at least 23 individuals since 2004 (T. Leenders pers. comm. 2013). A second subpopulation was found in 2008 in Las Tablas near San Vito (González-Maya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Gonzalez-Maya&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013),&#160;whereas, surveys conducted from 2002 to 2004 had failed to find this species in the&#160;area (Santos-Barrera <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160;Since the 2008 assessment, this species has been rediscovered in a few historical sites, as well as, five new sites, where individuals are easily encountered (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop 2019). In Las Alturas de Cotón, it is consistently recorded; however, the abundance varies by year (Gonzalez-Maya&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018;&#160;D. Gómez pers. comm. September 2019; Gómez-Hoyos <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;One individual was reported&#160;near Buenos Aires (Solano-Cascante <em>et al. </em>2014). Ongoing monitoring of the subpopulation in the Alexander&#160;Skutch&#160;Biological Corridor suggests it is currently surviving in low numbers (Jiménez<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2019), while the subpopulations at Ojochal and forests near La Lucha appear to be recovering (C. Barrio-Amorós&#160;pers. comm.&#160;September&#160;2019).&#160;The pattern of reappearances of this species is not clear. In some cases, it has appeared in small&#160;secluded creeks (Barrio-Amorós and Abarca 2016), and&#160;in others, in large, open, and fast flowing&#160;rivers (Gonzalez-Maya <em>et al. </em>2013, Solano-Cascante <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is likely too early to determine whether the new observations cited in this reassessment represent a genuine recovery from a population crash or if it is simply a product of increased survey effort (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>In Panama, this species has declined from most of its former range due to chytridiomycosis (Perez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Hertz <em>et al</em>. 2012, McCaffery 2015) and it persists only at six localities. Hertz <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded four individuals in Parque Nacional Santa Fé, and the species has been recorded in very low numbers recently in the parts of central Panama&#160;(Perez <em>et al</em>. 2014) including&#160;Tigrero, Toabre, San Lucas and Donoso. It is unknown whether the species is still declining. Persisting subpopulations appear to have evolved anti-<em>Bd</em> skin peptides raising the potential for recovery of wild populations (Voyles <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The population began declining in northern Costa Rica in 1988, by 1993 declines were recorded at the border with Panama, spread to El Copé&#160;by 2004 and to El Valle by 2006 (Lips <em>et al.</em> 2006). This species was approaching the thresholds of the threatened categories in 1980 and was tentatively assessed in 2004 (""backcasted"") as Near Threatened in 1980. By 1988, the species may have started to pass the threshold of Vulnerable as <em>Bd</em>-related declines began. By 2004, it was estimated that 80% of the population had been lost in the ten years prior and was ""believed to still be in serious decline"" (IUCN 2004). The same is true of the 2008 assessment, which also estimated a decline of 80% or more since 1998 and also assessed the population to ""still be in serious decline"" (IUCN 2008). In 2018, the generation length has been estimated at seven years, making the time period over which decline should be measured for this species a 21-year period. The change in generation length estimate, however, does not change the estimates of past assessments.",Unknown,"This species is known from both Atlantic and Pacific versants of the cordilleras of Costa Rica and western Panama, from 16-2,000 m asl. It is absent from the&#160;Pacific&#160;lowlands in its northern range (Savage 2002). In the 2008 assessment, it was documented that drastic declines had reduced the Costa Rican range to only<strong> </strong>two known localities; however, the species has since been recorded at four historical sites (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop 2019) and in five additional areas, including near Rainmaker (J. Abarca pers. comm.&#160;September&#160;2019), near Ojochal, near Savegre (C. Barrio-Amorós pers. comm. September 2019), and Alexander Skutch Biological Corridor (A.&#160;Jiménez&#160;pers. comm.&#160;September&#160;2019).&#160;In Panama, it has been extirpated in most of its former range, persisting at only six localities in the eastern part of its range.&#160;The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the current extant range is 4,403 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;<p><strong></strong></p>","It was collected by the thousands in the 1970s and shipped to Germany as part of the international pet trade.

This is a high priority species in the Panama Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ANAM 2011), and a stake-holder based conservation action plan was developed under the IUCN Species Survival Commission in 2014 (Estrada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Preliminary monitoring is ongoing and a long-term&#160;monitoring programme is being initiated in Santa Fe, Panama (M. O'Donnell pers. comm. September 2019). A strategy is being developed to monitor the subpopulation, environmental education and promote this species as a flagship for the Corredor Biológico Alexander Skutch (A. González pers. comm. September 2019). Monitoring efforts are in place in Las Alturas de Cotón (D. Gomez pers comm. September 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species' captive husbandry is well known and documented, and serves as a model for other captive&#160;<em>Atelopus</em>&#160;programs (Poole 2006).&#160;Two captive-breeding programmes have been initiated for this species in the US, one managed by the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore under the auspices of Project Golden Frog and a second established by the Cleveland Zoo in 2005&#160;(Estrada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). An assurance population collected from Parque Nacional Santa Fe, Panama in 2018 is being held at the Manchester Museum (M. O'Donnell pers. comm. September 2019). An in-country <em>ex-situ </em>programme to manage and breed&#160;<em>Atelopus varius&#160;</em>is also in place at the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center and the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project (Estrada&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

March 2016, B. Gratwicke pers. comm. February 2017, Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop 2019). There is a need to establish an <em>ex-situ</em> assurance population in Costa Rica (Chaves<em> et al</em>. 2014).

It can be observed in bushes and trees along forest streams, and is restricted to forest covered streams. Larvae develop in streams. Tadpoles are described by Hoffman (2010).","In Panama the species is generally threatened by habitat loss, but overall there are no major threats to the species. At certain sites in Panama, declines were observed in 2007 after the detection of <em>Bd</em> in 2006; thus, chytridiomycosis may be a problem for this species (Woodhams <em>et al</em>. 2008). The causes of the apparent historical decline in Costa Rica are not understood. Some logging activities were documented at one of the sites on the NNE slope of Volcán&#160;Turriabla in 2011, but they have likely since ceased (B. Kubicki per. comm.

The species was last recorded near Volcán Turriabla in 2013, as there have been few recent surveys in the&#160;area in part due to difficulty with site access (B. Kubicki pers. comm.

The eastern Panamanian subpopulations have drastically declined in sites were it was formerly common,&#160;by at least 80% over a ten year period. Given that the Panamanian range comprises <em>c</em>. 50% of the global population, it is reasonable to suspect that the population has experienced a decline of&#160;at least a 40% during 2009–2019.","It is a terrestrial and diurnal species of humid lowland, premontane and montane forest. Adults may be encountered along rocky sections of forest streams. It can occur in secondary forest and tree plantations, and occurs in degraded habitats in Colombia. The eggs are deposited in the leaf-litter and the males transport hatching tadpoles to forest streams to complete metamorphosis.","This species appears to have undergone rapid, dramatic declines across the western and central part of the range, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane, steam-associated species across Mesoamerica (Gratwicke<em> et al</em>. 2016; Costa Rica and Panama Red List Assessment Workshops 2019).&#160;Climate change or the synergistic effects of multiple factors could have played a role in the declines (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019). Lips <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported that 48 dead individuals of this species&#160;(infected with <em>Bd</em>) were recorded at El Copé, Panama in 2004, where it is now thought to be locally extinct (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2010; Panama Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019).<br/><br/>Ongoing habitat loss is another major threat; in Panama, it is likely affected by agriculture, including cattle ranching, logging and expanding human settlement (Panama Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019). In Colombia, illegal gold and platinum mining is driving deforestation, causing pollution and sedimentation of rivers and destroying the river banks which this species uses to reproduce&#160;(G. Medina-Rangel pers. comm. June 2018). In the northern portion of its Colombian range, forest is being cleared to create pastureland, which is created and maintained by burning (G. Medina-Rangel pers. comm. June 2018).","This species is known from only two Costa Rican localities, Las Cruces and the San Vito area (Santos-Berrera<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2008). In the 1980s,&#160;this species was commonly heard calling during visits to Las Cruces (F. Bolanos pers. comm. September 2019). In 2012, short surveys did not record the species at Las Cruces (F. Bolanos pers. comm. September 2019), however, many individuals were heard calling there in 2018 and 2019 (C. Barrio-Amorós pers. comm. September 2019). Long-term survey data from field courses run by the Organization of Tropical Studies (from the 1980s and 2012) suggest that this species drastically declined in Costa Rica, probably starting in the 1990s until 2002 (S. Whitfield pers. comm. September 2019).<br/><br/>This frog was formerly common in Panama, but has experienced drastic declines and only remains in the form of very small subpopulations in Cerro Campana and some localities in eastern Panama (Panama Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019).&#160;It was last observed in Parque Nacional Altos de Campana in 2016, when a single individual was recorded (A. Sosa pers. comm. August 2019). In eastern Panama, 18&#160;individuals were observed at Cerro Brewster in 2009 (Sosa and Guerrel 2013), but subsequent surveys to the same site in 2011 and 2013 did not re-record the species (A. Sosa pers. comm. August 2019). Evidence suggests that the amphibian chytrid fungus,<em>&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(<em>Bd</em>), arrived to this area sometime around 2009 (Panama Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019). In 2016, one individual was recorded in Area de Uso Múltiple Donoso (J. Guerrel pers. comm. August 2019) and another individual was recorded in the same area the following year (M. Ponce pers. comm.

The eggs are usually deposited on leaf surfaces and the larvae are washed off or fall into water below the site of oviposition.","<p>The massive declines noted in this species may have been due to chytridiomycosis (Gratwicke<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2016). However, studies by Woodhams&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2006) found that among the species studied this was one of the more resistant to infection; possibly explaining its continued persistence at lower numbers. Ranavirus is a potential threat, as infected individuals have been documented in Siquirres; however, the effect of this virus remains unknown (S. Whitfield and H. Zumbado-Ulate pers. comm. September 2019).<br/><br/>General habitat loss and fragmentation remains a threat throughout this species' range, and this is especially the case in Costa Rica where deforestation by squatters threatens Fila Asunción, one of the two confirmed remaining subpopulations in the country. The other extant subpopulation at Siquirres is currently protected by a private landowner; however should the ownership change in the future, the security of this subpopulation could be at risk (Costa Rica Red List Workshop September 2019). The other historical sites in Costa Rica have been deforested for agriculture and livestock ranching (Costa Rica Red List Workshop September 2019). Deforestation and illegal mining are the main threats in the area where the species has been registered in Colombia (G.F. Medina-Rangel pers. comm. February 2019).</p>","It was once considered to be a reasonably common species in Costa Rica, but most subpopulations disappeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&#160;As of 2019, the species has been reported with certainty from only three areas in Costa Rica: Fila Asunción, 15 km south-west of Limón in&#160;Veraguas&#160;(an abandoned farm); in a forested area near Parque Nacional Barbilla and Siquirres in&#160;Limón&#160;Province (B.

Bolaños pers. comm. September 2019).&#160;Fila Asunción&#160;is the only site known to have a large breeding subpopulation (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019). In 2003, the species was&#160;intentionally reintroduced to a historical site in Siquirres; ca. 75 tadpoles rescued from another site ca. 30 km away (airline distance) and introduced to the area, and the species is now colonizing other neighboring properties, all of which are within its general historical range (B. Kubicki pers. comm. September 2019). All other previously known Costa Rican subpopulations are thought to have disappeared, including those in Monteverde, San Ramón, Parque Nacional Braulio Carrillo, and Parque Nacional Tapantí.

The status of the Colombian subpopulations remains unknown.<br/><br/>Overall, the population is thought to be decreasing due to a combination of ongoing decline in the extent and quality of habitat and disease. It is reasonable to estimate that the remaining population has experienced a decline of 80-95% since 1998 (21 years/three generation lengths) based on the disappearance of the western and central Panamanian population, probably due to chytridiomycosis (Lips&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Hertz<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia.

General habitat loss through deforestation and pollution of waterways are localized threats. In Colombia, artisanal mining is a threat to its microhabitat given that this species always occupies the rocky edges of streams and artisanal mining radically alters this habitat type (G.F.

Where the removal of rocky, riparian habitat has taken place, individuals have not been observed again for a long period of time, until more than two years have elapsed (G.F.

January 2019). Over the course of these surveys, a gradual decline in the number of observed individuals was documented in the localities where the species was formerly more abundant; this decline is apparently due to habitat alteration caused by artisanal mining and pollution from fumigations of illegal crops with glyphosate&#160;(G.F.

Females lay their eggs on leaf surfaces and brood them.","The most likely cause of decline at lower elevations is the destruction of natural forests as a result of logging, agriculture and human settlement, and possibly infection with chytridiomycosis. This is a paradoxical species because it has remained stable at higher elevations in Costa Rica, in contrast to many other species in which the higher elevation populations have declined most drastically. In Panama, some higher elevation populations have declined at El Copé, presumably due to the effects of chytridiomycosis (see Lips <em>et al</em>. 2006).

It occurs mainly on continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 60 m. The American Cownose Ray is among the least productive elasmobranchs with a generation length of 14 years and an estimated median intrinsic rate of population growth rate r = 0.008. It is an opportunistic predator of benthic invertebrates but in the United States has long been persecuted&#160;due to perceptions they feed primarily on commercial bivalves leading to claims&#160;they led to the collapse of commercial bivalve populations along the USA East Coast through a trophic cascade. This led to the development of the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' fishery which was promoted by state fishery managers, seafood companies, some environmental organizations and local 'eco-friendly' restaurants&#160;as well as the development of tournaments to cull the “nuisance” cownose rays. Whereas American Cownose Ray did prey on historically abundant soft-shell clams (<em>Mya </em>spp.)<em>, </em>other commercial bivalves make up a very small proportion of the diet and collapse of the bivalve stocks were primarily due to overfishing and other causes. Following the publication of a rebuttal of the trophic cascade and the implication that American Cownose Rays caused the collapse of shellfish populations, the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign has declined in popularity. In the&#160;Gulf of Mexico,&#160;a relative abundance time-series of a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey reveals that the population increased through 1987–2010 and has been declining ever since yet the overall estimated annual rate of increase is 2.5% but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened. In the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other species, and there is no reason to suspect that this species has also not been reduced in numbers in that area. For example, there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings in Venezuela. Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (43 years) in that part of its range. Due to the increasing abundance in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of  Mexico, combined with suspected steep reductions in population size in  the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the American Cownose Ray has undergone an overall population reduction of 30–49% over the  past three generation lengths (43 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The American Cownose Ray is a large, benthopelagic ray that migrates in large schools throughout its range (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>It occurs mainly on continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 60 m (Weigmann 2016).&#160;There are&#160;differences in some life history parameters between the Gulf of Mexico and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The species reaches a maximum size of ~110 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 64–85 cm DW, females mature at 62–92 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 20–43 cm DW (McEachran and de Carvalho 2002, Last<em> et al</em>. 2016). American Cownose Ray from the Gulf of Mexico mature more quickly (4–5 years) and at smaller sizes (64 cm disc width (DW) for males; 65 cm DW for females) than the Northwest Atlantic where females mature at 90–94 cm DW and 7–8 years in Chesapeake Bay (Smith and Merriner 1986,&#160;Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and litter size is typically one individual per female (98% of cases), with a gestation period of 11–12 months (Neer and Thompson 2005, Fisher&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013). Consequently, cownose rays are among the least productive elasmobranchs, with estimated intrinsic rate of population growth rates (r) ranging from −0.018 yr<sup>−1</sup> to 0.032 yr<sup>−1 </sup>(median r = 0.008) (Grubbs <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;Generation&#160;length was estimated as 14.3 years based on an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","In the United States, the American Cownose Ray had a long history of negative interactions with the commercial shellfish industry (Blankenship 1998). American Cownose Rays have been implicated in negatively affecting the recovery of Bay Scallop&#160;<strong>(</strong><em>Argopecten irradians</em>)&#160;stocks in North Carolina and oyster restoration and commercial aquaculture efforts in Chesapeake Bay. A mitigation attempt to decrease predation on shellfish resulted in an unregulated fishery for the American Cownose Ray (Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2013). Claims that the American Cownose Ray population increased dramatically due to top-down predation release (Myers <em>et al. </em>2007) led to the&#160;justification of the development of a fishery for American Cownose Rays as a form of predator control to decrease mortality rates on populations of commercially valuable bivalves. The 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign was touted as a way to restore the health of Chesapeake Bay by facilitating recovery of collapsed oyster populations. The fishery was promoted by state fishery managers, seafood companies, some environmental organisations, and regional 'eco-friendly' restaurants&#160;and there were many attempts to develop export markets for the meat in Europe and Asia. Due to limited markets for the meat, bowfishing tournaments developed in Virginia and Maryland as continued forms of perceived predator control.&#160;Following the publication of Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2016), which rebutted the trophic cascade and the implication that cownose rays caused the collapse of shellfish populations, the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign has declined in popularity.&#160;Maryland implemented a moratorium on the bowfishing tournaments for Cownose Ray, however&#160;there are many charter captains that take customers out to shoot Cownose Ray between Texas and Virginia (R.D. Grubbs pers. comm. 21/8/2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a seasonal, localised target fishery in Campeche Bay (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2012) and it is also taken as a small bycatch of fisheries in the Caribbean (M.P. Blanco-Parra<strong>&#160;</strong>unpubl. data 2019).&#160;Artisanal  fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,  and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries  in many areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread  and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl  fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia  unpubl. data 2018); this species is targeted there along with other cownose and eagle rays. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches  followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza  2015)<em></em>. Groundfish fisheries on the  Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these  fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels  crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). In northern  Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks  were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other elasmobranchs have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed  (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species has no geographic refuge from fishing in Atlantic South America, and does  not have refuge at depth.","Genetic analysis of mitochondrial markers shows significant differentiation between the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico (Carney <em>et al.</em> 2017). Population trend data are available from multiple data sources in the Gulf of Mexico (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker<em> et al.</em> 2018, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the Gulf of Mexico, the relative abundance time-series based on analysis of a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey from 1987 to 2018 (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) shows a steady increase in catch rate until a peak around 2010, followed by a steady decline to the end of the time-series. Overall, abundance&#160;increased at an annual rate of change of +2.5%, but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened (NT = 3%, VU = 6%, EN = 7%, and CR = 1%).&#160;<br/><br/>In Caribbean Colombia, there are no time-series of abundance but this species is targeted in intense gillnet fisheries that are likely causing a reduction in the population size there.&#160;<span class=""st"">In Venezuela, declines in the abundance of rays including this species were reported as far back as the early 1970s (Ginés&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1972, cited in Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). There are unmanaged artisanal gillnet fisheries that continue to capture species with broadly similar catchability (e.g. Whitespotted Eagle Ray,&#160;<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>) (Tagliafico<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012), and there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings&#160;(Tagliafico and Rago 2009). There are no  data from northern Brazil, but commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense, unmanaged, and have led to worrying declines in other species,  and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been  reduced in numbers in that area. Due to  the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some  areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has  undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three  generation lengths (43 years)&#160;in the Atlantic South American part  of its range.<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> Due to the increasing abundance in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, combined with suspected steep reductions in population size in the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the American Cownose Ray has undergone an overall population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (43 years). <br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The American Cownose Ray occurs widely in the Northwest, Western Centra and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from Massachusetts, USA to Uruguay&#160;(Last <em>et al. </em>2016) and seems to co-occur with congener the Brazilian Cownose Ray <em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>&#160;in Brazil, from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina State (Gallo-da-Silva&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997 in Menni and Stehmann 2000) and in the southern Gulf of Mexico (Palacios-Barreto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","Generally, cownose and eagle rays are caught as utilised bycatch of artisanal fisheries and the meat is consumed locally fresh or salted (Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

In the USA, the American Cownose Ray has long been regarded as a pest by the commercial shellfish industry (see Threats) and when harvested under predator control programs are usually discarded dead. Under the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign, Cownose Ray wings were marketed for consumption in regional seafood restaurants in Virginia and Maryland, USA (Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

There are no species-specific protections or management measures in place in the southern Caribbean or South America. Further research is needed on taxonomy, life history, population size and trend, and threats. All fisheries should be managed for bycatch at the species level.","",,false,false,Global
3091753,60201,Sphyrna media,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Scoophead Shark (<em>Sphyrna media</em>) is a medium-sized (to 150 cm total length) hammerhead that occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico to northern Peru and in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to southern Brazil. It inhabits waters over continental shelves from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, which are typically unmanaged and operate throughout its range. It may also be caught in trawl fisheries. The declining numbers of records over the past several decades and range contraction in some areas indicates that this shark has undergone population reduction in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. In the Pacific, records have become increasingly rare and this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Records are sparse from elsewhere in Pacific Mexico and Central America and occur rarely in Colombia and Ecuador. The Atlantic South American portion of the population has also been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this species is considered rare. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records in Bahia state;&#160;records of sphyrnid sharks there have been declining in number since the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely. There are no recent records from southern Brazil. Overall, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, as well as the degradation of mangrove habitats, and has undergone range retractions in some areas. There have been very few recent records and it is inferred that the Scoophead Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Scoophead Shark inhabits waters over continental shelves from inshore to 100 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL); females mature at 100–133 cm TL and males at 90–100 cm TL; reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to young that are 34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be about 12 years, based on available data for the congeneric Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum recorded age of 18 years (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014).","The Scoophead Shark is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries. This hammerhead is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, it has no refuge at depth, and it has been depleted in several areas. <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that   often target sharks have been operating for many decades in   the Gulf of California, Mexico, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and   other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Unmanaged artisanal fisheries   targeting sharks including this species have been  operating  around   Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965), although there is a three-month seasonal ban on the take of sharks that has been in place since 2012. Further south in this  portion of the  species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists  with little  management in place, and there are commercial  longline and  trawl fisheries off many areas of Pacific Central and  South America. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In the Atlantic part of its range, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,   and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas. Caribbean Colombia is dominated by artisanal fisheries  and there were an estimated 14,000 artisanal fishers on the Colombian  coast in the Caribbean in 2006 (Wielgus <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since  1995, fishers there have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition  of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent  increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating  at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and  expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). These fisheries are known to catch the congener Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>) (Acevedo <em>et al.</em>  2007) and are likely to also capture this species. Effort in this  fishery peaked in 1990 and declined substantially until the early 2000s (<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">García <em>et al. </em>2007).  Furthermore, lack of enforcement capacity has led to illegal fishing by  Honduran and Nicaraguan vessels in Colombian waters (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>  2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense,  lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed  by  declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).  Groundfish fisheries on  the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015). Gillnets and  artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of  Brazil's coast, other Sphyrnids are captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2014), and this species is also likely to be caught. <span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In  northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of  target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s  (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and  unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the  disappearance of several other elasmobranch species in the region  (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016). In  northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense,  gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that  stocks are over-exploited, and other sharks have been depleted including congeners  (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014).  In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).  Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being  collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). Overall, this shark is subject to intense, largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, and it has no refuge at depth. <br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","There is evidence of population reduction in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. In the Eastern Central Pacific, this shark was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and off the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernández-Carvallo 1967). Records became increasingly rare from the 1980s onwards, and it is no longer present in the Gulf of California; there were only three records from Mexico in the two decades leading up to 2014, all of which were restricted to southern Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017). Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, J.-C. Pérez-Jiménez unpubl. data 2018). This shark has not been encountered in Pacific Central America since the 1980s; there are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna </em>species (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). To summarize the situation in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.<br/><br/>The Atlantic South American portion of the population has been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark has been very rarely reported (Grijalba <em>et al</em>. 2009, García and Armenteras 2015), and is thought to never have been common. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. In Brazil, intense fishing pressure is suspected to have led to a population reduction. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state; records of sphyrnid sharks there became increasingly rare during the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely (Reis-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2014). To summarize the situation in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).<br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Scoophead Shark occurred historically in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico to northern Peru and in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to southern Brazil (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

Hammerheads are among the main shark species in the fin trade and are among the preferred species for shark fin soup. Although other larger congenerics are preferred in trade, it is likely that this species also enters the international market, as demand for smaller fins is increasing (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2019). The meat is likely consumed or sold locally, but may also be exported to Brazil where demand is rising (Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific  protections or conservation measures in  place for the Scoophead Shark outside of Brazil.  In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing   from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.   Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). In Brazil, it is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the    Environment Nº 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species    listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National    Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Gadig <em>et al. </em>2018). This legislation came into   force  in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015   and the  first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry   (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017).  The ordinance faces increasing industry   pressure, including a current court  challenge to suspend the legislation   again by the Secretaria Nacional  de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who   brought forward their contention that  the Brazilian National Red List   was designed specifically for  terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate. Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory and up to 5% in the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening&#160;compliance (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on life history, population size and trends, and threats. To conserve populations and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest&#160; management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement.","",,false,false,Global

Catch rates decline from 2.87 kg per hour to 0.43 kg per hour in the 2000s, equivalent to a population reduction of 85% over three generation lengths (27 years).&#160;Records are becoming increasingly rare across eastern and southern Brazil, where this species has not been recorded for more than 15 years from the eleven states between Ceará (in the northeastern Brazil), to&#160;Paraná (in the southeastern Brazil). Demographic modelling suggests the fishing mortality far exceeded population growth rates and a population reduction of &gt;90% over three generations was estimated for the core distribution of this species. Due to  the intense and largely unmanaged nature of fisheries in the region, the  decreasing probability of catches, the relative lack of recent  records in many parts of its range, and alarming declines in other  elasmobranchs in the core of its range (northern South America), it is  suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of  &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and the Smalltail Shark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.&#160;<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The Smalltail Shark inhabits muddy inshore areas and estuaries down to a depth of 84 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Overall, the Smalltail Shark is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range.&#160;<span lang=""en""><span title=""""><span lang=""en""><span title=""""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","There are no range-wide estimates of population size or trend.

This maximum reported depth is from Exuma Sound and may be inflated due to the very deep thermocline of the sound. Similar increases in maximum depth have been for other deep-water sharks from Exuma Sound (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). The depth range of Cuban Dogfish in the northern Gulf of Mexico is 50–430 m and may be more representative of the normal range for this species (C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019).

The diet comprises mainly of fruits and insects, although they have been observed eating a wide variety of other invertebrates, eggs, and small vertebrate prey, including coati pups. They also occasionally eat leaves, flowers, stems, and nectar.

Like all beaked whales, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is a deep diver, found mainly in deep, oceanic waters, but they can occur close to shore, especially around islands and continental shelf edges (MacLeod and Zuur 2005). In Hawaii, there appears to be a resident, island-associated population, and a more pelagic, open-ocean population with overlapping ranges. There is high site-fidelity among the Hawaii resident types, with re-sightings spanning more than 20 yr in some cases (Baird <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019). Median group size in Hawaii is 3 (range 1-11), generally with no long-lasting associations, and most groups have only a single adult male present.</p>  <p>Maximum dive depth and time recorded for Blainville’s Beaked Whale in Hawaii is 1,599 m and 83.4 min, respectively; it regularly dives to 1000 m and for over 1 hr, which, for slope-inhabiting populations, suggests that they are foraging at or near the bottom (Arranz <em>et al</em>. 2011, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2006, Baird 2019). Three different types of dives have been recorded: long, deep dives for foraging; short, shallow (2-4 m) dives near the surface for breathing, and a series of intermediate dives (30-300 m) that appear to help them avoid detection by predators (sharks and killer whales) when they are near the surface (Augilar de Soto <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019).</p>  <p>Little is known about the prey of Blainville’s Beaked Whale. A review by Allen <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that stomach contents from stranded whales consisted mainly of beaks and otoliths from various species of meso- and bathypelagic squids and fishes, and some crustaceans. Like all ziphiids, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is a suction feeder (Heyning and Mead 1996), and Madsen <em>et al.</em> (2013) suggested they catch, on average, about 25 individual prey items/dive.</p>","<p>There has never been a directed fishery for this species, but small numbers are taken opportunistically and incidentally in fishing gear. Dolar (1994) investigated directed fisheries for marine mammals in the Philippines and reported that hunters at Pamilacan Island sometimes take small whales, including <em>M. densirostris</em>. Also taken opportunistically in the past off Japan. Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drowned (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009), including Blainville’s Beaked Whale (Jefferson et al. 1993, Ilangakoon 2002, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Blainville’s Beaked Whales are occasionally hooked in longline gear (Forney 2010).<br/> <br/> Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). In 1993, an adult Blainville's Beaked Whale that washed ashore in southern Brazil had a bundle of plastic threads that occupied a large part of the main stomach chamber (Secchi and Zarzur 1999). Both stomach and intestines were completely free of parasites, as well as food remains and feces, indicating that the whale had not fed for some time. The ingested plastic may have resulted in a false sensation of satiation for the animal, which could have reduced the whale's appetite and meal size and, in turn, led to the death of the whale. This form of pollution may be increasing and could be a threat to the species.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic survey operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of mid-frequency active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in mass strandings of beaked whales, including Blainville’s Beaked Whales (Balcomb and Claridge 2001,&#160; D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em> . 2019). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em> . 2019). Sub-lethal effects may also occur, with Blainville’s Beaked Whales reducing foraging activity (as measured by echolocation) and moving away from Navy vessels using mid-frequency active sonar (e.g., Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2016; Manzano-Roth <em>et al</em>. 2016; Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020). This has the potential to result in reduced reproductive rates for individuals that are regularly exposed to mid-frequency active sonar (New <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987), including moderate levels in Blainville’s Beaked Whales (Taruski <em>et al</em>., 1975, Aguilar<em> et al</em>. 1982; Bachman <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some cases have been reported (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009, Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; </p>","<p>Overall, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is fairly common in at least some areas of its range and is considered to be perhaps the most abundant species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Estimates of abundance are generally unavailable for most areas. In the Hawaiian EEZ waters Bradford <em>et al</em>. (in press) estimated 839 (CV=1.05) Blainville’s Beaked Whales in 2002, 1,740 (CV=1.05) in 2010, and 1,132 (CV=.99) in 2017. Off Hawaii Island Baird <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 125 “marked” individuals (CV=.30) using photo-identification over a four-year period (2003-2006), with a corrected estimate (accounting for unmarked individuals) of 140. Mullin and Fulling (2004) estimated 106 (CV=.41) mesoplodonts in the northern Gulf of Mexico, including both <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>. Waring <em>et al.</em> (2009) later estimated 57 (CV=1.40) mesoplodonts (<em>i.e</em>., <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>, combined) in the Gulf of Mexico from a later set of surveys. Ferguson and Barlow (2001) estimated a total of 32,678 mesoplodonts in the eastern Pacific (corrected for missed animals), in an area where nearly all the identified mesoplodonts are either <em>M. peruvianus</em> or <em>M. densirostris</em> (Pitman and Lynn 2001, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009). During a line transect acoustic and visual survey of the entire coast of Tanzania, Blainville’s Beaked Whales were the fourth most frequently encountered marine mammal (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photo-identification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, Bahamas, Canary Islands) limited movements and strong site fidelity have been documented, suggesting substantial population structure (Baird 2019, Claridge 2013, Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020, Reyes Suárez 2017). </p>",Unknown,"<p>Blainville’s Beaked Whales are easily the most widely distributed of all the mesoplodont species and occur in tropical and warm temperate waters of all oceans (Mead 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012). They mostly occur in open ocean waters, but also in some semi-enclosed deep-sea areas, such as the Sea of Japan, Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea but they have not been recorded in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; In the tropical Western Indian Ocean, Blainville’s Beaked Whales are the most frequently encountered mesoplodont and occur around several island archipelagos including Comoros, Mauritius, Mayotte and the Seychelles (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; In the eastern North Pacific, sightings and strandings have occurred from 37.3°N to 41.5°S in cooler waters&#160;but are rare in this region (MacLeod <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>",<p>This species is occasionally taken in artisanal fisheries (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>,Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

They are very widely distributed in oceanic waters worldwide. They are uncommon south of the Antarctic Convergence (60°S) (Branch and Butterworth 2001). Principal threats include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and seismic surveys in the Northern Hemisphere, and fishery bycatch. As a species, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales do not meet any IUCN Red List criteria for a threatened listing and are considered Least Concern. The Mediterranean subpopulation is classified as Vulnerable on the Red List (Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018).<em> </em>It is likely that other subpopulations exist, and once identified they could be assessed separately.</p><p></p>","<p>Although they can be found nearly anywhere in deep (&gt;200 m) oceanic waters, Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is an oceanic species often associated with steep slope habitat with a marked preference for submarine canyons and escarpments (Azzellino <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2012, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2003, MacLeod 2005, Podestá <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cañadas and Vazquez 2014, Cañadas <em>et al.</em> 2017). Off Japan, whaling records indicate that <em>Z. cavirostris</em> is most commonly found in waters deeper than 1,000 m (Heyning 1989). The species is known around many oceanic islands (e.g., Baird 2016,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Reyes Suárez 2018)., and in some enclosed seas. It is rarely found close to mainland shores, except in submarine canyons or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and coastal waters are deep (Heyning 1989, 2002) and is mostly a pelagic species that appears to be confined by the 10°C isotherm and the 1,000 m bathymetric contour (Houston 1991, Robineau and di Natale 1995).<br/> <br/> Like all beaked whales, Cuvier's Beaked Whales appear to prefer deep waters for feeding. They regularly dive over 1,000 m and have been recorded diving to a depth of 2,992 m and for up to 137.5 minutes (Schorr <em>et al</em>. 2014, Baird 2019, Shearer <em>et al.</em> 2019). They appear to feed mostly on deep-sea squid, but also sometimes take fish and crustaceans (Heyning 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005). In the North Pacific West <em>et al.</em> (2017) noted fish in three of 16 stomachs examined, representing 12.1% of prey by mass overall. While five families of fish were documented, one species, <em>Albatrossia pectoralis,</em> made up 97% of the fish prey items documented. In addition, otoliths from the codling family Moridae were found in a specimen from South Africa (Sekiguchi 1994). They apparently feed both near the bottom and in the water column. As with other beaked whales, suction appears to be used to draw prey items into the mouth at close range (Heyning and Mead 1996).</p>","<p>Because of&#160;their offshore occurrence and tendency to feed on deep-sea squid, Cuvier’s&#160;Beaked Whales are probably little exposed to human activities that occur in coastal waters (tourism, many types of fisheries, etc.). However, the few studies carried out on this species highlight one main threat, which is certain forms of human caused underwater noise. This threat affects the species world-wide. Military sonars and possibly high-energy sounds from other anthropogenic sources have repeatedly resulted in the stranding and death of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Recent atypical mass strandings (AMSs) of Beaked Whales have been linked to high-powered naval sonar and seismic exploration (e.g., Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). Deployment of military sonar has led to strandings of beaked whales suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to the <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly the result of decompression sickness (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). In particular, several AMSs of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have been associated with naval activities in the Canary Islands, from the mid- to late-1980s until 2004 (Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em>. 2019). In 2004 a moratorium on mid-frequency active sonar was established by the Spanish Government around the Canary Islands and there have not been any additional AMSs since. Another AMS event occurred in March 2000 in the Bahamas during a naval exercise (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2000, Anon. 2001). A number of AMS events in the Mediterranean were consistent with naval activity in the region (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). Moore<em> et al</em>. (2018)<em> </em>also reported that AMSs were strongly correlated in locations (Japan, Puerto Rico and Italy) where US Naval fleets were based. Simonis<em> et al. </em>(2020) report that three of eight Cuvier’s Beaked Whale stranding events in the Mariana Archipelago (totaling 10-11 individuals) between 2006 and February 2019 occurred during or within six days after naval activities, and that this co-occurrence was highly significant. This study also highlighted that both single animal and mass stranding events may be sonar-associated. The US Navy is funding research to explore possible mitigation measures. Geophyical surveys which use airguns for oil and gas exploration are also of concern, particularly in the Mediterranean (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). A stranding of two Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the Gulf of California was closely correlated with a seismic survey (Malakoff 2002).<em></em></p>  <p>Never a main target of commercial whalers, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have sometimes been taken as bycatch in other directed fisheries, such as those in the Caribbean Islands, Indonesia, Taiwan, Peru, and Chile (Heyning 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the Japanese <em>Berardius</em> fishery, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were taken in the past on an opportunistic basis, with catches varying from 3 to 35 animals yearly (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1955). Although the <em>Berardius</em> fishery still continues, there have been no direct takes of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales for decades (Nishiwaki and Oguro 1972).</p>  <p>Bycatch of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales has been reported in several commercial fisheries. Julian and Beeson (1998) reported a mortality of 22-44 individuals per year in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery from 1992 to 1995.&#160;The introduction of the use of pingers in the fishery in 1996 resulted in a complete cessation of bycatch in this fishery (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Willis and Baird (1998) noted one Cuvier’s Beaked Whale killed in a fishery for flying squid offshore of western Canada in 1986. Notarbartolo di Sciara (1990) reported on two Cuvier's Beaked Whales that were thought to have been killed in the Italian Swordfish (<em>Xiphius gladius</em>) fishery during 1986-1988. Bycatch in the western North Atlantic is very low, with one animal reported between 1994 and 1998 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are occasionally taken incidentally in driftnets in the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the driftnet ban of 2002, occasional bycatch in pelagic driftnets was reported from Spanish, French, and Italian waters (Banca Dati Italiana Spiaggiamenti 2015, Podestà and Magnaghi 1989). But, there are also reports of entanglements after the ban. During the MED09 survey in the Alborán Sea, a Cuvier´s Beaked Whale was found alive entangled in a driftnet, and two Moroccan driftnet fishing vessels were spotted a few miles away.&#160;</p>  <p>There are reports of ingestion of plastic debris by Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Two stranded animals in Greece had stomachs with many pieces of plastic bags (A. Frantzis pers. comm., Frantzis 2009), as did a stranded animal in Croatia (Holcer <em>et al</em>. 2007. Other reports are described in Gomerčić <em>et al</em>. (2006), and Podestà and Meotti (1991). Poncelet <em>et al</em>. (1999) described a considerable amount of plastic debris in the stomach of a Cuvier’s Beaked Whale washed ashore on the French Atlantic coast. </p>  <p>Given their diet is primarily composed of deep-water squid, with smaller contributions of fish and crustaceans (West <em>et al</em>. 2017), there is relatively little competition with commercial fisheries (Arkhipkin <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Low levels of organochlorines were reported from Cuvier’s Beaked Whales from Hawaii and Bermuda (Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Knap and Jickells 1983). Low levels of flame retardant compounds were reported from this species (Law <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales, mainly mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, the residue levels in beaked whales are much lower than other small cetaceans (Cockcroft 1999). High concentrations of mercury, selenium and cadmium have been detected in animals sampled from the Ligurian Sea (Capelli <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em> </em>However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (O’Shea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p><p></p>","<p>Determining abundance of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales is difficult for several reasons: 1) they are widely distributed in offshore waters of most of the world’s oceans; 2) in areas where multiple species of beaked whales occur some sightings cannot be identified to species; 3) they regularly make long, deep dives and animals may be below the surface and not detected during surveys; and 4) the body size is relatively small and group size is often small making detection in rough offshore waters difficult even if the animals are at the surface.<em> </em>Global abundance of this species is unknown but there are estimates of numbers in some areas. </p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated an abundance of about 20,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.27) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the eastern tropical Pacific region (19 million km<sup>2</sup>), but a re-analysis of the same data increased the estimate to about 80,000 after accounting for diving animals that were missed (Ferguson and Barlow 2001). Barlow (2003) estimated Cuvier’s Beaked Whale abundance off the U.S. west coast from shipboard surveys as 8,311 (CV = 0.50) in 1991-1993, 1,876 (CV = 0.81) in 1996, and 1,892 (CV =1.08) in 2001. A survey of that same region in 2014 yielded an abundance estimate of 3,775 (CV = 0.68) (Barlow 2016). A trend analysis of all data from surveys conducted during 1991-2014 estimated the number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in this region as 3,928 (CV = 0.67) in 2014, with evidence of a decline in abundance over the study period that occurred mostly between 1993 and 1996 (Moore and Barlow 2013).</p>  <p>Shipboard surveys of the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Hawaiian Islands in 2002, 2010 and 2017 produced abundance estimates of 1,216 (CV=0.77), 338 (CV=1.01) and 4,431 (CV=0.41) in the three years, respectively (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were the most abundant beaked whale of the three species documented in two of the three years (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Using photoidentification data, Baird (2016) estimated that 52 animals used the west side of Hawaii Island over a four-year study period.</p>  <p>Waring <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported results of shipboard and aerial surveys conducted in 2011 in the western North Atlantic from the lower Bay of Fundy to central Florida and estimated 6,532 (CV = 0.32) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the survey area, but these estimates were not corrected to account for those individuals that were diving.<strong> </strong>In an area of 15,765 km<sup>2</sup> off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, McLellan et al. (2018) estimated between 50 (95% CI 30-80) and 90 (95% CI 110-380) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, depending on the assumptions used regarding surfacing synchronicity. In summer 2009, surveys dedicated to estimating cetacean abundance were conducted in offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulting in an abundance estimate for Cuvier’s Beaked Whales of 74 (CV = 1.04). The estimate for unidentified beaked whales was also 74 (CV = 1.04), and may have also included an unknown number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cañadas <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated 2,286 (CV = 0.49) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the European Atlantic based on ship-based surveys conducted during 2005-2009. This estimate was adjusted for unidentified beaked whales but not for diving. Podestà <em>et al.</em> (2016) estimated that about 100 individuals are found in the northern Ligurian Sea. Using photo-identification off El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Reyes Suárez (2017) estimated 87 (95% CI 73-103) or 84 (95% CI 70-101) individuals over a six-year period.</p>  <p>Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are undoubtedly among the most common and abundant of all the beaked whales, and worldwide abundance is likely to be well over 100,000. There is no information on trends in abundance for any population. except off the west coast of the United States (Moore and Barlow 2013). This is the only widely-distributed beaked whale species for which a global assessment of genetic diversity has been conducted. The results of that study suggest that there is probably little movement of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales among ocean basins (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), which suggests the existence of local subpopulations including one in the Mediterranean Sea (Cañadas and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photoidentification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, North Carolina, Ligurian Sea, Canary Islands), limited movements and strong site fidelity has been documented, suggesting substantial subpopulation structure (Baird 2019, Foley <em>et al</em>. in review, Podestà <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reyes Suárez 2018).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Cuvier's Beaked Whales have the most extensive range of any beaked whale species (Heyning 1989, 2002, Baird 2018). They are widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions, in both hemispheres. Their range covers most marine waters of the world, with the exception of shallow areas and very high-latitude polar regions. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk (but not in the Baltic,Black or Red Seas). This is the only species of beaked whale regularly found in the Mediterranean Sea (Podestà&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). South of the Antarctic Convergence (60°S) they are uncommon (Branch and Butterworth 2001).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The Cuvier’s Beaked Whale was hunted at a low, and largely opportunistic, level. Nishiwaki and Oguro (1972) reported that 189 Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were caught at coastal whaling station in Japan during 1965-1970 and that such operations had diminished in later years. Some small direct takes have been reported off&#160; Indonesia (Baird 2018).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The&#160;Cuvier’s Beaked Whale&#160;is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). <br/> <br/> In 2004, the Parties to the UNEP Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS) Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) adopted a resolution recommending that human activities introducing high-intensity noise in the marine environment be avoided in the agreement area where high concentrations of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales may occur. The agreement’s Scientific Committee is currently modelling Mediterranean sighting data to generate predictive habitat maps for that purpose.</p><br/><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It can tolerate very limited habitat degradation. Breeding takes place by direct development.","The main threat to this species is the opening up of its forest habitat for agriculture, livestock, and increasing human settlement.&#160;Past declines within suitable habitat are consistent with chytridiomycosis, however this inference requires verification. The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, “Bsal”</em>) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016).

58303674,39375,Carcharhinus melanopterus,Vulnerable,A2bcd,2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus melanopterus</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 180 cm TL) coastal shark that occurs in coral reef and associated habitats in tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the surface down to a depth of at least 75 m. The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries through much of its range in gears including longline, gillnet, handline and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth, and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in the habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 51.2% over three generation lengths (44 years), but this is likely an over-estimate because of complex spatial and ecological factors that affect the abundance of this species. Therefore, the Blacktip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation  and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Blacktip Reef Shark is a coastal species that is common in shallow water on and near coral reefs, where it occurs from the surface to depths of at least 75 m. It is often associated with coral reefs, but in many locations the young  use mangrove systems early in life if they are available (Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm total length (TL) and maturity is reached between 90 and 134 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Stevens 1984, Last and Stevens 2009, Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013b).&#160;Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 2–4 pups (Compagno 1984, Lyle 1987, Last and Stevens 2009), a biennial reproductive cycle (Stevens 1984) and a size-at-birth of 30–50 cm TL (Mourier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Great Barrier Reef males mature at 4.2 years and females at 8.5 years. Longevity of field sampled individuals was estimated as 15 years, but this is known to be an underestimation due to limitations in age estimation methods, and captive animals have lived for over 25 years (Chin<em> et al</em>. 2013b); using these age data the generation length is estimated to be between 12–17 years (average of 14.5 years).","The Blacktip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small scale longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in continental shelf waters and those around oceanic islands and reefs, especially those around coral reefs. Most are taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. For example, in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef it makes up 1.1% of shark catch in inshore gillnets (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and 5% of sharks caught in the line fishery for reef teleosts (Heupel <em>et al. </em>2009). In Indonesia it makes up 0.3% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Blacktip Reef Shark makes up more than half of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. There is limited species-specific catch trend data available for most countries, however, throughout much of the species' range there are intensive coastal fisheries that are likely to exert significant pressure on the stocks. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and the effort continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2012), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.<br/><br/>This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","Genetic studies support the presence of multiple subpopulations throughout its range, with structure detected between and within island groups in the Pacific (Vingnaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). How many subpopulations exist is currently unknown because of limited sampling of most locations.<br/><br/>The Blacktip Reef Shark in common in tropical and subtropical waters but there is little data available on population status and trends. Severe localized depletions in reef sharks, that include the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been recorded from the Indian Ocean (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on diving survey data, Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks in the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 sharks per dive in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a population reduction of 94% over three generations (44 years). Species-specific data were available for the period between 1996 and 2006 and showed a decline in the Blacktip Reef Shark to a level where it was rarely encountered in 2006 (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Towed-diver surveys performed in the&#160;Western Central Pacific&#160;between 2004 and 2010&#160;showed that reef shark densities are higher at remote locations with very limited or no human presence&#160;(Nadon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Based on a modelling approach, they estimated that reef sharks (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) in this region&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">have declined to 3–10% of baseline levels, with baseline considered absence of humans (Nadon&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2012)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Approximately 6% of all the sharks recorded during towed surveys (4,620 sharks) were the Blacktip Reef Shark, which was not present at all sites.&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on this information it is suspected that reef shark populations, including the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been reduced in the Western Central Pacific, particularly in islands such as the Hawaiian Main Island, Mariana Islands, and Samoa that have high human population densities (Chin <em>et al.</em> 2011, <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Nadon <em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2012)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Given the high level of population structuring in this species, localised studies are unlikely to provide a good indication of overall population trend. In many parts of south and east Asia (e.g. Sri Lanka, Myanmar) this is the only reef shark species that remains, following the loss of species such as the Grey Reef Shark and Whitetip Reef Shark, suggesting that population declines are not as severe as reported for these other species.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">To account for differences in the trend of Blacktip Reef Shark between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed using data from the Global Finprint project (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020)&#160; that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to total global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Blacktip Reef Sharks was estimated as 51.2% (standard error 43.3–59.6%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (44 years) (see Supplementary Information). The error estimates include both the IUCN Red List Vulnerable and Endangered categories. However, the ability of the Global Finprint data to estimate depletion for this species is limited by complex ecological patterns not accounted for in the methodology. As a result it over-estimates the level of decline at some reefs where population levels are thought to be healthy. As such, it is estimated that the Blacktip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Blacktip Reef Shark&#160;is a common tropical Indo-West Pacific and central Pacific species occurring from Africa to Central Pacific, including most of the islands with coral reefs (Compagno 1984, Last and Stevens 2009).

MPAs are common in coral reef areas of many range states throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020).

68619155,41798,Deania calcea,Near Threatened,A2bd,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a&#160;widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans.&#160;It occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopes&#160;at depths of 60–1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths &gt;400 m.&#160;The species is&#160;caught as both targeted and incidental catch in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries&#160;operating across most its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There has been a number of management measures implemented in recent years, both species-specific and more generally for deep-water sharks.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but increasing trends in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Birdbeak Dogfish is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (90 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Birdbeak Dogfish occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 60–1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths &gt;400 m (Neat <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 73–94 cm TL and females mature at 94–106 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter size of 6–12 pups and&#160;size-at-birth is&#160;28–34 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al</em>. 2013).&#160;There are slight regional differences in age parameters. In the Northeast Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 25 years and maximum age is 35 years; resulting in a generation length of 30 years (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2002). In the Southwest Pacific, female age-at-maturity is 21.5 years and maximum age is 37 years; resulting in a generation length of 29.25 years (Irvine<em> et al. </em>2012).","<p>The Birdbeak Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries.<br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Trawl survey records indicate peak depth distribution of the species is also at depths &gt;800 m (Neat&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). At vessel mortality is high, and post release mortality is likely to be high as well (Rodríguez-Cabello&#160;and Sanchez&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the East Central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), and in hake fisheries operating off Chile (SUBPESCA 2017).<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Birdbeak Dogfish to have extreme vulnerability to midwater trawl and demersal longline fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean, and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, the&#160;Birdbeak Dogfish is one of the most deep-water shark species reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Francis 2015), with trawl survey records indicating peak depth distribution at depths &gt;800 m (Anderson <em>et al. </em>1998). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from industrial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018), and <a>a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker, unpubl. data 2019). Any <em>Deania </em>spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013).</a></p>","<p>Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. Population genetics have indicated some genetic variability between populations (Keggin 2017). Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of dogfishes, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp). Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019), and (2) relative abundance in the Southwest Pacific (Walker and Gason 2007,&#160;Francis<em> et al.</em> 2016, Stevens<em> et al. </em>2017, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018, O’Driscoll <em>et al. </em>2018). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths (90 years for the Northeast Atlantic and 87.8 years for the Southwest) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, in the Northeast Atlantic, relative abundance estimates of <em>Deania </em>spp (Birdbeak Dogfish and Arrowhead Dogfish, <em>Deania profundorum</em>) from Spanish and Scottish trawl survey series suggest fluctuating trends since 1983 and 1998, respectively, with some indication of increasing CPUE since 2009 (F. Neat, unpubl. data 2019, ICES-WGEF 2018). Trend analysis of Scottish trawl survey data from 1998 to 2019 revealed an annual rate of increase of 12%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;100% over the past three generation lengths (90 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. Industrial landings of the Birdbeak Dogfish in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~195 t in 2004–05, before rapidly declining to 3 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018). <em>Deania </em>spp were often the most abundant deep-water shark in research surveys (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Second, relative biomass were combined from southeast Australia and surveys from New Zealand Chatham Rise and Sub-Antarctic (Walker and Gason 2007,&#160;Francis<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Stevens<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017, Stevens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, O’Driscoll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The combined relative abundance data indicated declines from 1991 to 2003 followed by an increase in abundance. This increase likely follows the implementation of management measures, including improved reporting. The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 0.07%, consistent with an estimated increase of 7.2% over the three generation lengths (87.8 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. In Australia,&#160;significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of dogfishes (mainly&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp and&#160;<em>Squalus&#160;</em>spp)&#160;from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;Catches of&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp were reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean annual catch estimate of 257 t between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007). In New Zealand,&#160;the Birdbeak Dogfish is considered to have a relatively large sized population (Ford&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s (Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 65% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (87.8 years) for the Birdbeak Dogfish, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/><br/>The Birdbeak Dogfish population is estimated to have increased in the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest Pacific and is suspected to have declined in the Northwest Pacific and West Africa. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median increase was 62.7%, with the highest probability of no major reduction over three generation lengths (90 years). Trends were estimated to be reflective of ~80% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 20–29% is estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Birdbeak Dogfish&#160;has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The species has historically been utilized for its flesh and liver oil (sold as ""pearl shark"" or ""deepsea flake"" in Australia). Fins from <em>Deania </em>spp have been reported&#160;in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Birdbeak Dogfish, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa and South America. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). The species is considered a ""key species of concern"" within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius</em>&#160;spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>In Australia, deep-water sharks, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, divided into eastern and western zone fisheries&#160;(Patterson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).

A combination of fishery closures and reduced TACs,&#160;trawling closures to protect benthic habitat &gt;700 m in waters of&#160;the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF)&#160;since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.</p>","",,false,false,Global

Within this broad range, aggregations are sparsely distributed&#160;and while individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently and exhibit a degree of philopatry resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion.&#160;The global population size is not known, but local and regional abundance has been estimated and is mostly small, numbering less than&#160;500 individuals, except for Ecuador where abundance is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals.&#160;The species has an extremely slow life history, producing only 1 pup on average every 4–5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) of any elasmobranch. Giant Manta Rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale tuna fisheries. The meat is consumed locally, and the species is traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. Where Giant Manta Ray are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. Elsewhere, however, very rapid declines have been noted in&#160;sightings records and landings where they are targeted or caught as bycatch; these range from 71 to 95% declines over 13- to 21-year periods (all less than one generation length of 29 years). It is suspected that the Giant Manta Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three  generation lengths (87 years), with further population reduction  suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2105) due to current and ongoing levels of exploitation, and a reduction in area of occupancy due to suspected  local and regional extinctions, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd+A3d.","<p>The Giant Manta Ray is a neritic and oceanic pelagic ray that occurs in places&#160;with regular upwelling along  coastlines, oceanic islands, and offshore pinnacles and seamounts  (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The Giant Manta Ray can exhibit diel  patterns in habitat use, moving inshore during the day to clean and  socialize in shallow waters, and then moving offshore at night to feed  to depths of 1,000 meters (Hearn&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Burgess 2017). It can spend long periods of time offshore without visiting shallow coastal waters (Stewart&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, A. Marshall unpubl. data 2019). The Giant Manta Ray may be the largest living ray species attaining a maximum size of 700 cm disc width (DW) with anecdotal reports up to 910 cm DW (Compagno 1999, Alava <em>et al. </em>2002). Males mature at 350<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>400 cm DW and females mature at 380<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>500 cm DW (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last<em> et al.</em> 2016, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a single large pup of 122<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>200 cm DW (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproductive periodicity is unknown, but assumed to be 4<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>5 years, similar to the closely related Reef Manta Ray (<em>M. alfredi</em>). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 8.6 years of age but first pregnancy may be delayed by up to 4 years (making first age of pregnancy 12 years) depending upon food availability (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). The maximum age is estimated as 45 years, based on the longevity of the Reef Manta Ray; generation length is therefore estimated as 29 years. Based on this life history, the maximum intrinsic rate of population  increase could range between 0.019 and 0.046 per year (median 0.032 per  year) (J. Carlson unpubl. data 2019, following methods in Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2014). The species is among the longest-living rays and has an extremely conservative life history; the  average Giant Manta Ray may produce only 4–7 pups during its estimated  lifespan, which would contribute to its slow recovery from population reductions due to over-exploitation or other threats.</p>","<p>  </p><p>Mobulid rays, including the Giant Manta Ray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gill nets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Manta rays are also caught in bather protection nets (Cliff and Dudley 2011, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries 2018).  Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate,  makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine  and longline fisheries and targeted capture in artisanal fisheries (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Duffy and Griffiths  2017). In particular, Giant Manta Rays are easy to target because of  their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate, predictable habitat  use, and lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/></p>  <p>Mobula rays, including Giant Manta Rays, are caught in at least 13  targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries. Some of the largest  documented fisheries have been in Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Sri  Lanka, México, Taiwan, Mozambique, Palestine (Gaza strip), and Peru (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013, Croll<em> et al</em>. 2016), where sometimes thousands of manta rays are landed per annum (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dewar 2002, White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Lewis<em> et al.</em>  2015). While many artisanal fisheries have grown to meet international trade demand for gill plates,  some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Essumang 2010, Rohner <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p><p>Mobula rays, including Giant Manta Rays, are caught incidentally as  bycatch throughout their ranges in at least 21 small scale fisheries in  15 countries and 9 large-scale fisheries in 11 countries (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016).  Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically retained because of their high trade value. Even when discarded alive, e.g. from tuna purse seine fisheries, they are  often injured and have high post-release mortality  (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017).&#160;Many  fisheries remain open and active even after dozens of national fishing  bans and international listings on the appendices of both Convention for  the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora  and Fauna (CITES) (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018). </p><p>Global landings of mobulid species, including Giant Manta Ray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, O’Malley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, total landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not landed elsewhere') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009). This  equates to an average of 1,593 metric t being landed per annum with this average increasing to 4,462 metric t per annum from 2008 to 2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019); reported  landings are likely to estimate only a fraction of total fishing-related  mortality (Ward-Paige<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/></p><p></p>  <p>  </p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). The source locations for the largest   amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Vietnam   (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017). Demand   for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from   60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). <br/></p><p>In the Western Indian Ocean, Romanov (2002) estimated that between 253 and 539 manta rays and devilrays were  being caught per year as bycatch in purse seine fisheries, and between  2003 and 2007, 35 manta rays were observed in  purse seine bycatch, most of which were likely Giant Manta Ray (Amandè <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Western and Central Pacific, from 2010<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2015,  observed bycatch of Giant Manta Rays in purse seine fisheries was 4,176  individuals, and in  longline fisheries was 226 individuals (based on  distribution, some of these were likely Giant Manta Ray<em></em>)  (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer, 2016). While a few individuals were  released in good condition, post-release mortality is likely to be high  as most were released alive but injured, or dead (Francis and Jones  2017). The Eastern Pacific purse seine fisheries show a substantial   increase in the bycatch of mobulid rays, including Giant Manta Rays,   from 20 tonnes per year before 2005 to 150 tonnes per year by  2006,  which then reduced to 10 tonnes per year by 2009 (Hall and Roman  2013).  The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) purse seine   vessels operating from 1993<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2015 reported an average catch of   approximately&#160;135 Giant Manta Rays per year (Miller and Klimovich 2017).   A&#160;susceptibility analysis indicated that negative interactions with   fishing gear and unintended mortality will continue to be an issue with   this species as these fisheries coincide with high productivity areas   where Giant Manta Rays are likely to aggregate for feeding (Duffy and   Griffiths 2017, Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>While the overwhelming cause of population reduction is fishing mortality, sublethal effects and lower levels of mortality occur from numerous lesser threats, such as entanglement in nets, recreational foul hooking, and vessel strikes (Marshall and Bennett 2010, Deakos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Couturier<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). While there is no direct evidence, there are concerns for effects of climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other forms of pollution and contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). Furthermore, shallow water lagoon nursery habitats are subject to habitat loss and degradation that pose threats to juvenile Giant Manta Rays (Stewart<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p>","<p>The global population size of the Giant Manta Ray is difficult to assess, but abundance trajectories have been estimated based on long time series of sightings at diving sites. Generally, divers encounter the Giant Manta Ray less frequently than the Reef Manta Ray (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>) and this is thought to be due to their more oceanic habitat preferences and behaviour. Locally, abundance varies substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they were, or are currently, being fished. In most regions, Giant Manta Ray population sizes appear to be small (less than 1,000 individuals). Photo-identification studies at specific aggregation sites have yielded minimum estimates of 42 to 500 individuals over almost a decade of monitoring in most locations, including: Mozambique, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), Japan (Kashiwagi <em>et al.</em> 2010), Brazil (Luiz <em>et al.</em> 2008), and Mexico (Rubin 2002). A 6-year study has catalogued more than 2,000 individuals in a single site, off mainland Ecuador (Holmberg and Marshall 2018).</p>  <p>Giant Manta Ray aggregation sites are widely separated and the lack of genetic substructuring indicates occasional large-scale movements have occurred. Crossing referencing of regional photo-identification databases has not detected inter-region individual movements (e.g. across ocean basins) (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), indicating a low degree of interchange between ocean basins. Unlike the Reef Manta Ray, no significant genetic substructuring has been detected within the Giant Manta Ray (Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Hosegood&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).  Long-term studies, including those which have incorporated telemetry,  have shown low resighting rates but a degree of philopatry. <br/></p>  <p>The trend of the number of individuals varies widely across the range of the Giant Manta Ray, but trends appear stable where they are protected and declining rapidly where fishing pressure is greater. The sighting trends appear stable where they receive some level of protections, such as Hawaii (Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Ecuador (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), although individuals sighted in Ecuador seasonally migrate to Peru (A. Marshall unpubl. data 2019) where directed  fishing occurs (Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Elsewhere, the number of individuals is likely to be declining in places where the species is targeted or caught regularly as bycatch. There are<strong> </strong>two estimates based on sightings-per-unit-effort. In southern Mozambique, a 94% decline in diver sighting records occurred over a 15-year period in a well-studied population (Rohner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Cocos Island, Costa Rica there has been an 89% decline in diver sighting records of Giant Manta Rays over a 21-year period (White<em> et al. </em>2015). These steep declines have occurred in less than one generation length (29 years).</p>Along with these sightings data, it is suspected (based on historical sightings, distribution data, and habitat suitability), that the Giant Manta Ray may have been depleted in areas where significant fisheries or threats  for manta rays exist, such as the west coast of mainland Mexico (Booda  1984, Rubin 2002), Madagascar, Tanzania (Bianchi 1985), Kenya, Somalia, Pakistan (Nawaz and  Khan 2015, Moazzam 2018), India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In these densely populated and heavily fished countries, fishing pressure may have more swiftly depleted resident populations of Giant Manta Rays. <br/><br/>There are narratives consistent with rapid local depletion<em>, </em>and disappearance of manta rays, particularly in Indonesia. In Lamakera, eastern Indonesia, increasing international trade demand for manta ray products in the 1990s resulted in increased fishing effort with up to 2,400 manta and devilrays landed per year. Consequently, manta ray catches (including Giant Manta Ray) declined sharply in this region, forcing fishers to travel further afield to find manta rays (Dewar 2002). Furthermore, landings of <em>Manta </em>spp. (including Giant Manta Ray which was the main target) continued to decline in Lamakera despite increased effort, with a reduction in landings of 75% over a 13-year period from 2001<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2014 leading to possible local extinction of <em>Manta </em>spp. from Lamakera (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Landings of <em>Manta</em> spp. also declined significantly during the same 13-year period in two other regions in Indonesia where effort also increased: Tanjung Luar (Lombok) (95% declines) and Cilicap (Central Java) (71% declines) (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). Aggregations of manta rays have entirely disappeared from three other locations within Indonesia, that is Lembeh Strait, South Sulawesi and Northwest Alor, with the cause strongly suspected as targeted and bycatch fishing (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). In East Flores and Lembata, Indonesia, manta rays (including the Giant Manta Ray) had historically been fished by  indigenous villagers&#160;since 1959, with up to 360 individuals caught a year (Barnes  2005). By 2001, less than 10 manta rays had been seen per year for the  previous 6-year period (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In the Bohol Sea, Philipines, manta rays (including Giant Manta Rays) were targeted for over a century with landings estimated to have declined since the 1960s by 50<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>90%, despite increasing fishing effort (Alava<em> et al. </em>2002). Concern for the species led to a ban on targeting of Giant Manta Rays in the Philippines in 1998, yet other <em>Mobula </em>species could still be targeted and Giant Manta Ray continued to be caught (Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2017, all targeted <em>Mobula</em> fisheries in the Bohol Seas were banned, yet <em>Mobula </em>species may still be taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries in the Bohol Sea (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).   Declining trends in the abundance and body size of mobulid fisheries landings  occurred both in India&#160;and Sri Lanka (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Pillai  1998, Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Raje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In Papua New Guinea, local declines have been noted and are attributed to fishing pressure (Rose 2008). Unspecified manta rays (some of which, based on distribution records, were likely Giant Manta Rays) were caught as non-target species in purse seine sets from 1995<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2006. There was a distinct and significant rise in the number of manta rays caught in these fisheries in 2001, which steadily rose until 2005/2006 when sharp declines were noted in the catch (Rose 2008).&#160; <br/><br/>    Although sparse, the available data suggest that localized populations of the Giant Manta Ray have been rapidly depleted by target fisheries in some regions and that local extinction is suspected to have occurred in many parts of their historical range. Globally, the suspected population reduction is 50<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>79% over three generation lengths (87 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>2105), based on current and ongoing threats and exploitation levels, steep declines in monitored populations, and a reduction in area of occupancy.

The meat from mobulids is  often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin of  mobulids is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and  knife handles).

Even with legislative protection in some areas, fisheries for manta ray persist in others and there are more locations still where they are incidentally captured as bycatch in artisanal as well as small and large fisheries.&#160;With little to no effort to monitor or regulate mobulid fisheries in many countries, these current paper regulations are proving inadequate and misleading.</p><p>Manta rays have been listed in the appendices of a number of international conventions.

As a threatened species whose wide-ranging migratory tendencies put it at risk, this listing acknowledges the fact that this species would benefit from the implementation of cooperative international agreements to manage and protect its populations and encourages range states to work together toward this goal.<em> Manta </em>species (i.e., including Giant Manta Ray) were listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2013, requiring fishing states to legitimize all exports through a permitting system based on non-detrimental findings which delimit acceptable, sustainable catches. <br/></p><p>Some Regional Fishing Management Organizations (RFMOs) have formally prohibited the retention of manta rays as bycatch, however most regulatory systems doing an inadequate job of protecting mobulids  from fishing mortality. <em></em>In 2015, recognizing the threatened status of mobulids, including the Giant Manta Ray,<strong> </strong>IATTC adopted recommendations which prohibited retaining, trans-shipping, landing, storing or selling, in whole or in part, any species of <em>Mobula</em> and required going forward that all mobulids be promptly released alive under strict non-detrimental protocols (Lawson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018).

This stingray is captured in demersal trawl fisheries and in artisanal gillnets and  longlines, which are intense and largely unmanaged across its range. It is targeted or retained as bycatch throughout its range, and a  demographic analysis indicated that this species has a  low intrinsic  growth potential and limited capacity to withstand fishing  pressure. Landings in artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of California were  stable between 1997 and 2009 at ~500 t, but increased after that<em></em>. It is suspected that this species  likely underwent a population reduction prior to this time-series in the  1980s and early 1990s, as gillnet fisheries increased substantially in  the area during that time<em></em>. In Peru, directed  gillnet fisheries landings for this species have seen a decline of 50%  in annual landed biomass between 1997 and 2015, equivalent to a population reduction of  &gt;88% over three generations (57 years). Although data are lacking elsewhere in its range, similar unmanaged fishing pressure exists in other areas and reductions are suspected. It may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the Hawaiian and Galápagos Islands. Overall, given its life history, the presence of intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure  across most of its range, its lack of refuge at depth, the noted declines and sparsity of records in the  southern portion of its range, balanced with its possible refuge from unmanaged fishing in some areas, it is suspected that the Diamond Stingray has  undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (57 years) based on levels of exploitation, and it<em>&#160;</em>is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<em></em>The Diamond Stingray inhabits sand and mud bottoms, rocky reefs, and kelp beds on continental and insular shelves to a depth of 150 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Generation length is 19 years.&#160;</span></span></span>","The Diamond Stingray is captured in demersal trawl fisheries and in artisanal gillnets and longlines. This ray has long been an important component of artisanal catch in the Gulf of California, Mexico. It is captured in low numbers in shrimp trawl fisheries there, and is caught commonly in the northern Gulf of California hake fishery (Santana-Morales <em>et al. </em>2004). It is also an important component of artisanal fisheries on the Pacific Coast of Baja California. It is caught in relatively low numbers in the Guatemalan and Colombian shrimp trawl fisheries (Ixquiac-Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 2010,&#160;Navia 2002, Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). It is a targeted species in the Peruvian artisanal gillnet fishery. Smith <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported a demographic analysis that indicated that this species has a low intrinsic growth potential and limited capacity to withstand fishing pressure. There is no refuge from fishing at depth; there may be some refuge off southern California and the Hawaiian and Galápagos&#160;Islands (although illegal fishing persists there - see Schiller <em>et al.</em> 2015).","Landings of Diamond Stingray in artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of California were stable between 1997 and 2009 at ~500 t per year, but increased following that (Saldaña-Ruiz <em style="""">et al. </em>2016). It is suspected that this species likely underwent a population reduction prior to this time-series in the 1980s and early 1990s, as gillnet fisheries increased substantially in the area during that time (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). In Peru, directed gillnet fisheries landings for this species have seen a decline of 50% in annual landed biomass between 1997 and 2015 (Ministerio de la Producción unpubl. data 2019), equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;88% over three generations (57 years).      Given its life history, the presence of intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across much of its range, its lack of refuge at depth, the noted reduction in Peru and the general sparsity of records in the southern portion of its range, balanced with its possible refuge from unmanaged fishing in southern California and off the Hawaiian and Galápagos&#160;Islands, it is suspected that this stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30<span class=""dc_bld dc_si"">–49% over the past three generations (57 years).",Decreasing,"The Diamond Stingray occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from southern California, USA, to northern Peru, and in Hawaii and the <span class=""st"">Galápagos Islands, Ecuador (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).",This stingray is retained and the meat is consumed or sold locally.,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures for the Diamond Stingray.  In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing  from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.  Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos&#160;Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). However, the enforcement of regulations is limited and illegal fishing is prevalent, particularly for sharks (Hearn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Management measures are needed to ensure this species does not become more threatened in the near future. Further research is needed on population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring of  catch is needed in artisanal and commercial fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

Its diet suggests that it may be mesopelagic as well as demersal. It is a sporadic to regular bycatch in a number of deep-water fisheries, but much of its depth range is outside of fishing grounds and it therefore has considerable refuge in deeper waters. It also inhabits areas without deep-water fisheries (e.g. the Galápagos&#160;Islands). While there may been some declines in areas where it is a regular bycatch (e.g. Chile), the Combtooth Dogfish is not suspected to be approaching the population reduction thresholds, and it is assessed as Least Concern.","The Combtooth Dogfish occurs on continental and insular slopes at depths of 269–1,143 m and is associated with soft mud and sand habitats (Weigmann 2016, Ebert 2016). Based on the presence of mesopelagic prey items in its diet, this species may migrate into the water column to feed (Ebert 2003). It reaches a maximum size of 51 cm total length (TL); size-at-maturity of both sexes is 32 cm TL (Gatica and Acuña 2011, Ebert 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a litter size of 4–15 pups and a size-at-birth of 11–13 cm TL (Gatica and Acuña 2011).","The Combtooth Dogfish is a bycatch of deep-sea crustacean trawl fisheries for Red Squat Lobster (<em>Pleuroncodes monodon</em>), Yellow Squat Lobster (<em>Cervimunida johni</em>), and especially deep-sea shrimp (<em>Heterocarpus reedi</em>) off northern and central Chile which operate at depths of 259–498 m depth (González 2001, Acuña and Villarroel 2002, Acuña&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). In the deep-sea shrimp fishery, the Combtooth Dogfish&#160;is the third most abundant shark bycatch species, after the Hooktooth Dogfish (<em>Aculeola nigra</em>) and the Dusky Catshark (<em>Bythaelurus canescens</em>) (Acuña and Villarroel 2002). It is also a minor bycatch of longline fisheries for Southern Hake (<em>Merluccius australis</em>), Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) off southern Chile, which operate at depths of ~200–500 m (Vargas-Caro 2010, F. Concha unpubl. data 2019). It is an incidental bycatch of Sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>) traps in California, USA (Ebert 2003, 2016). However, much of its range is beyond depths that are fished, and there is a general lack of deep-sea fisheries over much of its range.","Population structure is unknown for the Combtooth Dogfish.

M<span class=""st"">aximum age in the wild is 17 years in southwest Florida (Hayne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018) and in captivity is 26 years (Henningsen 2002), and therefore generation length is estimated to be 11.3<span class=""st"">–15.8 years. We use the lower estimate as this is more similar to its congener the Longnose Stingray (<em>H. guttatus</em>)<em> </em>(F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018).</span>","<p>The Southern Stingray is captured as bycatch in artisanal trammel nets, gillnets, beach seines, and longlines, and in commercial trawl and longline fisheries.&#160;In some regions, interactions with tourism are considered a threat for this species, for example in the Grand Cayman Islands there have been changes to feeding habits, parasites, diel activity and predations risk (Corcoran&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Vaudo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). There is also the threat of habitat degradation, mainly mangrove, reefs and seagrass areas.</p><p>In Mexico, Southern Stingray&#160;comprises 55–92% of the batoids catches from the artisanal gillnet and mainly longline fisheries (Lara-Mendoza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;The catches range from 1046–2155 t per year with an average of 1341 t per year (J.C. Pérez-Jiménez pers. comm. 25/06/2019). In Cuba, this species is captured in the commercial shrimp trawl fishery operating off the southeast coast (Briones&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Southern Stingray are harvested in parts of South America and fisheries exist in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. Despite these fisheries, this stingray has shown signs of stability in several areas, and is productive enough to withstand some fishing pressure, but has also shown to be more susceptible in other areas where fishing is most intense.</p>","<p>There are no data on the population size of Southern Stingray. In the Northwest Atlantic, the relative abundance of this species is considered stable throughout its range in the Caribbean region and it is present in 81% of all the surveyed reefs (D. Cardeñosa and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019). In the southern Gulf of Mexico off Mexico, landings from the artisanal gillnet and mainly longline fisheries are considered stable from 2006 to 2014 (Lara-Mendoza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In Honduras (Roatan Island), a reduction in the size of the population was reported from 2016 to 2017 but no further data on this decline is available (MarAllianz Honduras unpubl. data 2019). It is abundant in nearshore waters in the northeast Gulf of Mexico,  especially along the west coast of Florida and is common during summer  months in estuaries and coastal areas along the east coast of the U.S.  It is common throughout most of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p><p>Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) from Belize based on baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) (G. Clementi and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019), (2) a scientific trawl survey in the Gulf of Mexico (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) and (3) landings data in Mexico (CONAPESCA, 2019, J.C. Pérez-Jiménez pers. comm. 21/6/2019). These trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Sherley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;First, the relative abundance time series based on BRUVs from 2009 to 2018 (G. Clementi and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019) off Belize indicated that abundance increased over the time series at a rate of 9.6% per year. Second, data from a trawl survey (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) indicated a decline of 4.1% over one generation (15.8 years). Third, landings data from Mexico from 2000 to 2014 suggests a general stable population (annual rate of change +0.5%) (CONAPESCA 2019, J.C. Pérez-Jiménez pers. comm. 21/6/2019).&#160;When all data sets are considered in the global analysis, the annual rate of change over all data series was -0.1%. The corresponding probabilities were in Least Concern (51%), Endangered (20%) and Critically Endangered (16%).&#160;In the southwest Atlantic, there are no range-wide estimates of population size for this species. It remains common across most of its range.&#160;In Colombia, the Southern Stingray was assessed as Near Threatened due to the level of exploitation and habitat degradation there (Navia<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017). There are no data for Venezuela and the Guianas, but there are intense artisanal fisheries there and it is suspected that these are leading to some reduction in population size. Taken with the evidence of stability from other studies, it is inferred&#160;this species is Least Concern in the Northwest Atlantic. Considering the relative area of habitat in Northwest Atlantic and Atlantic South America, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (32 years).<br/><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Southern Stingray occurs in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic Oceans from New Jersey, USA to Amapá, Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea&#160;(Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Petean&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).","Although it is generally discarded alive with suspected high survivorship in US waters, this species is utilized and even targeted in artisanal fisheries across much of the southern portion of its range. It is taken as a food source in Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala, Colombia (M. Pilar Blanco, J.C.&#160;Pérez Jiménez, A. Briones Bell-lloch, D. Cardeñosa unpubl. data 2019). Its meat is used as bait in Honduras, Barbados, Antiqua and Barbuda and possibly in the French Caribbean too (E. Espinoza and N. Simpson unpubl. data 2019). It is also considered an important species for interactions with tourists (Grand Caiman, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Mexico, Turks and Caicos).",Marine,"There are some protected areas across Caribbean countries (e.g. Mexican Caribbean, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Panama). In Guatemala, there are no-take periods of the year specific for stingrays but enforcement is a challenge (C. Avalos pers. comm. 21/6/2019). Belize has a large protected area which serves as a ray sanctuary (E. Espinoza pers. comm. 21/6/2019). In the United States, there are state net bans which would provide a refuge to fishing in states where they are implemented. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<p><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

Avalos unpubl. data 2019).","In the Western Central Atlantic, there are no population size or trend estimates for this species. Although there are no trend data from the Southwest Atlantic, there have been anecdotal declines in some areas, especially where these animals are targeted (for example in nursery areas off Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018). Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Colombia, this stingray has been exploited since the 1970s and has a high commercial value, and artisanal fisheries there are widespread and unmanaged. There is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery in Caribbean Colombia for which stocks have collapsed (P. Me<span class=""st"">j<span class=""st"">ía-Falla and A. Navia unpubl. data 2018). At the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery<span class=""st"">. There are small-scale demersal set longline fisheries there that capture this species and it is used for local consumption (D. Cardeñosa unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015), and this species has been noted in gillnet fisheries such as the one operating off Margarita Island (González‐González and Ehemann 2018). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks there were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In Cear<span class=""st"">á State, there has been a trawl ban implemented in one locality, and this species has shown signs of increased abundance there (V. Faria unpubl. data 2018). Longnose Stingrays are targeted heavily in artisanal beach seine fisheries in the northeast of Brazil. For example, suspected nursery grounds for this species are targeted and considered to be over-exploited in Rio Grande do Norte (F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018).&#160;The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). This stingray has been recognized as a bycatch in these trawl fisheries, and even when discarded suffers substantial injury and may not survive (Rodrigues&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Due to the actual and potential levels of exploitation across its shallow inshore range, the fact that it has exhibited declines where it is targeted, and its large size, it is suspected that the Longnose Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation (32 years) in Atlantic South America. Taking together the relative area of habitat in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (32 years).&#160;<span style="""">Due to its similar habitat use and biology to Southern Stingray (<em>Hypanus americanus</em>), but more southerly distribution in areas of intense fishing pressure a status of Near Threatened was inferred.</span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Longnose Stingray occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from the Gulf of Campeche, Mexico, to Paraná, Barzil (Barletta and Correa 1989)&#160;including the Caribbean Islands (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","This stingray is utilised for subsistence food and is sold locally, and the white flesh is considered valuable.

It is a wide-ranging species inhabiting continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from inshore to 90 m deep. The Bonnethead Shark&#160;is likely a species complex, with three distinct elements:&#160;the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (United States of America (USA), Bahamas, and Mexico), the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic&#160;(Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and the&#160;<a style="""">Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.&#160;</a>The species has among the highest population growth rates calculated for sharks, making it much less sensitive to fishing mortality than most other species of sharks. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. Despite its high productivity, drastic inferred declines have been reported throughout its range. The Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico) is stable due to management and in that region is assessed as Near Threatened. The Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic portion of the population has been reduced substantially in size. This shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s off the Caribbean Colombia, but is now very rare. In Brazil, this species was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro, collapsed in São Paulo, and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state, and fishers describe this species as being depleted and the species in that region is assessed as Critically Endangered. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including Bonnethead Shark, in the 1990s. Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca. This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. Its recent absence from large parts of its range in Central and South America and rarity of recent records across this part of its range infer that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) and it is assessed in that region as Critically Endangered. Overall, the combination of low fishing mortality in throughout the USA, declines in Atlantic Central America, combined with widespread disappearance in Southwest Atlantic and Pacific this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing and habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and shrimp aquaculture, and hence it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Bonnethead Shark inhabits continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from shore to 90 m depth (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL).&#160;The life history of this species has received considerable attention. Empirical data for populations of this species in the eastern Gulf of Mexico reveal a latitudinal increase in maximum size, size-at-maturity, and offspring size (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, males mature between 68–85 cm TL (2 years of age) and females generally mature between 80–95 cm TL (or 2–3 years of age) depending on geographic area. Reproduction is placental viviparous and annual, with a litter size of 4–16 pups and size-at-birth of 35–40 cm TL. The gestation period of this species is one of the shortest known in sharks, lasting ~4.5–5 months (Parsons 1993, Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). Demographic studies of this species by Cortés (2002) indicate that Bonnethead Shark have very high rate of population growth (mean = 1.304 per yr; 95% confidence interval = 1.150–1.165 per yr) making them one of the most productive species. In the Gulf of Mexico, maximum observed ages are 5–6 years or more for males and 7–8 years or more for females (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2003). Recent work off the southeastern coast of the United States has produced validated maximum age estimates of 16.0 years for males and 17.9 years for females (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014). Generation length is estimated to be 12 years.</p><a></a>","<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><p>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic,&#160;Bonnethead Shark is captured in primarily in gillnets, demersal trawls and recreationally on hook and line. Recreational catches averaged 12,898 individuals from 2012 to 2016 and commercial landings averaged 15,305 lbs dressed weight from 2011 to 2016. Bycatch in shrimp trawls averaged 167,981 individuals from 2007 to 2011.</p><p>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, a<span class=""text"">rtisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is the fourth most commonly-caught shark in artisanal longlines and gillnets (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em><span class=""text"">2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2015). Gillnets and artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of Brazil's coast, and this species is captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2014). In Uruguay, the industrial demersal trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many target stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2011).</span></span></p><p>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that often target sharks have been operating since at least mid-century in the Gulf of California, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Artisanal fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965). Later research has revealed that this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California and that very few records have come from the southern portion of Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). Further south in this portion of the species' range, heavy artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place, and there are unmanaged commercial longline and trawl fisheries off parts of western Central and South America.<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""> This  species may also suffer from&#160;habitat loss due to coastal development  and the conversion of mangrove forest to shrimp aquaculture is  detrimental to this species.<br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></span>","In the United States, highly significant genetic differences were observed among Bonnethead Shark from the Atlantic coast of Florida, Gulf coast of Florida, and southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Escatel-Luna <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trend data are available from broad-scale trends in relative abundance for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2017), a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey (Pollack 2018), and stock assessments for the US south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (NMFS 2013). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al.</em> 2018, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<span><span><br/><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span>First, in the Northwest Atlantic, Bonnethead Shark is a very abundant, small hammerhead found in shallow estuaries and bays. It is caught as target and bycatch in gillnet fisheries, and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. In the United States, Bonnethead Shark had undergone declines prior to management measures, and since the 1990s scientific surveys have demonstrated large increases in abundance. A stock assessment for the Gulf of Mexico and US south Atlantic found the stock was not overfished but some sensitivity analysis suggests it was overfished. The weighted overall population trend for the Northwest Atlantic estimated a 40% increase over 3 generation lengths (36 years). However, outside the United States (where quota management used), Mexico (where a closed season is implemented), and the Bahamas (where there is no shark harvest), where management may not exist, the species is captured in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp trawl and lobster fisheries (e.g. juvenile sharks in Costa Rica). There is a directed fishery in Quintana Roo, Mexico where the species is the third most important catch. It is present in landings in Cuba, Belize (mostly adults), Trinidad, and Panama (third most abundant species in gillnet fisheries). Expert judgement elicitation found that given the uncertainty in levels of harvest and its sustainability, Bonnethead Shark should be assessed as Near Threatened in this region.&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Second, the&#160;the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&#160;portion of the population has been reduced substantially&#160;in size. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s, but is now very rare (P.A. Mejía Falla and A.F. Navia/Squalus Foundation unpubl. data 2018). In Venezuela, this species remains among the most commonly caught shark but is subjected to heavy and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has suspected to have declined there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across The Guianas. In Brazil, Bonnethead Shark was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bizzeril and Costa 2001), collapsed in São Paulo (Bressan <em>et al. </em>2009), and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing&#160;(Passamani and Mendes 2007). There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state. Although several individuals were recorded there in a 2012–2013 study, the only other record since the 1980s is one from 1995 (Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). Overall in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records in Brazil. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernandez-Carvallo 1967). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965), and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including this species, in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. There are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna</em> species. This species is rare in gillnet and beach seine catches in Ecuador (A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2019). Overall in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><p>Overall,

It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas.

However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.</p><p>In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Degree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Degree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.</p><p>In Panama, there are some marine protected area in the middle and west of Panama, which can benefits shark populations because it establishes management in these areas like fishery controlled areas. However, enforcement is a challenge. In 2006, a regulation was approved that prohibited shark finning in Panama water. In 2017, another regulation was implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of number of hooks up to 1,000 per surface longline strand).</p><p>In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in The Bahamas in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year (UN FAO). The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004 (UN FAO). The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts in The Bahamas. This protection does not extend to rays or skates. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploita on may be occurring at present or in the future.</p><p>The Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species.&#160;</p>In the Southwest Atlantic, this species is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the  Environment Nº 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species  listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National  Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018). This legislation came into force  in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015 and the  first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017).  The ordinance faces increasing industry pressure, including a court  challenge to suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional  de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that  the Brazilian National Red List was designed specifically for  terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). In the Eastern Pacific, there&#160;are no species-specific protections or  conservation measures in place for Bonnethead Shark in the Pacific  portion of its range. <p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>  <p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It has been recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopes&#160;at depths of 50–1,400 m, and mostly between 400–800 m. The species is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years).&#160;Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, and the species&#160;is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range.&#160;Globally, the Little Gulper Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generations (180 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<strong><br/></strong>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The <a>Little Gulper Shark&#160;</a><span lang=""EN-GB"">is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 50–1,400 m, and mostly between 400–800 m (Weigmann 2016, C. Cotton, unpubl. data).&#160;Tracking data shows that in Australia at least this species has a restricted and narrow distribution and is mainly restricted to the upper continental slope between the 300–700 m bathymetric contours near the seafloor (Daley<em> et al </em>2015). It reaches a maximum size of 128 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~80 cm TL and females mature at ~96 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, fecundity is very low, with a single pup per litter, and size-at-birth estimated at 35–45 cm TL (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Generation length of this species is estimated at 60 years (B. Moe, pers. comm., 21/11/2019), but should be used with caution as further validation is required.&#160;</span></p>","<p>The Little Gulper Shark is taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in mid-water and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries. <br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). <br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and between 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019).&#160;Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, this species was previously reported in small quantities in Portuguese longline fisheries (ICES-WGEF 2018). It is reported in bottom longlines and trammel nets throughout the Mediterranean (Guallart 1998,&#160;<a class=""linked-name"" style=""font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"">Massutí and Moranta 2003,&#160;</a>Lteif<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The species likely has some refuge from fishing in the US Gulf of Mexico, where Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010). The species, however, is still susceptible to longline fisheries (Driggers <em>et al. </em>2017). Elsewhere in the Gulf, there are a number of deep-water fisheries where&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp have been reported (Benavides&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There are a number of deep-water fisheries from Venezuela, fishing at depths of 200–800 m; demersal chondrichthyans are not targeted but are encountered as bycatch (O. Lasso-Alcalá unpubl. data 2019). There is increasing interest in developing deep-water fisheries in the Caribbean (e.g.&#160;Paramo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) and the development of any fishery should be monitored as this species may be susceptible to being caught as bycatch.<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</p>","<p>Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of gulper sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nomimal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Gulf of Mexico (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019) (2)&#160;standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the&#160;Southwest Pacific (Walker and Gason 2007). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths (180 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, in the Gulf of Mexico, nominal CPUE between 2011–2018 (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019) showed&#160;an annual rate of increase of 10.7%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;120.4% over three generation lengths (180 years), with the highest probability (99%) of&#160;no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. <br/><br/>Second, the trend analysis using standardized CPUE between 1996–2006 off Southwest Australia showed&#160;an annual rate of decline of 11%, consistent with an estimated decrease of&#160;100% over three generation lengths (180 years), with the highest probability (88%) of &gt;80% reductions in population over three generation lengths. In addition, significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of gulper sharks&#160;(mainly&#160;<em>C. harrissoni</em>,&#160;<em>C. uyato</em>, and&#160;<em>C. moluccensis</em>) from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). This accounts for only a small proportion (&lt;10%) of the species known range. <br/><br/>Nearly all landings of gulper sharks other than the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) from the Northeast Atlantic have been reported from the Portuguese longline fishery (ICES-WGEF 2018). Annual landings were ~100 t until 2008, and rapidly declined to 2 t in 2009, likely in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018). In the Mediterranean, there are uncertainties with species identification in this region, but the species is considered generally rare (Bradai<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012), but may be locally abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea (Guallart 1998).<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including gulper sharks, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The gulper shark stock off India is suspected to have similarly collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing off western India. Gulper shark&#160;landings declined from 114 t in 2008 to 39 t in 2011 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl.&#160;data 2019), equating to a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generations (180 years).&#160;Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of gulper sharks&#160;declined from 18% to 1–14% between 1984–2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). In Sri Lanka, the targeted gulper shark fishery at Valaichchenai, which dates back to the 1980s, has seen a large reduction in effort, from 30 to 2 vessels, in recent years (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019). The rationale for this reduction in fleet is claimed to be self-regulation of the fishery, although lack of long-term economic and biological viability of the fishery is also suspected.<br/><br/>The Little Gulper Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range and estimated to be increasing in the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Little Gulper Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Mediterranean&#160;Sea, Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;</p>","<p></p><p>Gulper shark liver oil, rich in squalene, is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). Oil may be processed locally or shipped overseas (e.g. Dubai) for processing before sold on the international market. High grade oil is exported to Japan and the European Union (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019, K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). Flesh is sold to local markets (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), while waste products from liver oil production is utilized as aquaculture and poultry feed (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). Gulper shark fins are of low value (Jaiteh&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016), but have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018).</p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Leafscale Gulper Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Management action implemented for the conservation and long-term sustainability of deep-water sharks in the Northeast Atlantic may indirectly offer the species some refuge. These actions include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005.<br/><br/>In Australia, this species has the most detailed recovery plan for any deep-water shark in the world. Gulper sharks are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp). Both the Little Gulper Shark and Harrisson’s Dogfish (<em>C. harrissoni</em>) are listed as Conservation-Dependent under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Species are subject to recovery plans that specify management actions to halt fishing mortality, including combined trigger limits of these two species, a zero retention limit, and guidelines for handling practices (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Gulper shark protection areas (closed to all methods of fishing) were carefully implemented based on species' demographic data (Daley <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;Individual based simulation modelling of tracking data and life history predicted stock off southern Australia can recover from a precautionary estimate of 8% of initial numbers to 20%; however, this was estimated to take 64 years due to the low reproductive capacity of this species (Daley <em>et al.</em> 2019). In some areas, the species is still caught incidentally, and without fisheries closures, the stock is estimated to collapse in&#160;&lt;30 years (Daley <em>et al. </em>2019). A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), may offer refuge in this region.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is also a bycatch of large-scale and small-scale shrimp trawl fisheries and small-scale gillnet fisheries and is usually retained for its meat. There is little information available on catches in northern parts of its range and it is only irregularly recorded in El Salvador (Fuentes and Hernández 2004), Costa Rica (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2016, Espinoza <em>et al. </em>2018), and Colombia (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019). Catches are higher in Ecuador and Peru where it is a regular bycatch in the former (Tenelema-Delgado <em>et al. </em>2014), and a target species in the latter. The most important landing areas are northern and central Peru where between 1997 and 2015, catches fluctuated with declines from 2002 to 2006 before catches increased and peaked in 2007–2008, were then low between 2009 and 2013, before peaking again in 2014–2015; this species is the third most landed ray species in Peru as estimated from government landing reports (A.

In some areas it appears to be rare or in low abundance (e.g., El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia), but in others it is a common target or bycatch species (e.g., Ecuador, Peru), suggesting that its core distribution is in southern areas of its range.

The Pacific Guitarfish is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its range (including targeted fishing), with little refuge (except in some remote areas).<br/><br/>Overall, due to levels of exploitation from its exposure to inadequately managed fisheries throughout much of its range, it is suspected that the Pacific Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (15 years).</p>",Decreasing,The Pacific Guitarfish occurs from southern Mexico to northern Chile including the Galápagos&#160;Islands (Ecuador) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).,This guitarfish is retained and the meat is consumed or sold locally.,Marine,"There are no species-specific measures in place for the Pacific Guitarfish.&#160;In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.

Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. Benthic trawling and mechanized beach seines have been prohibited in the coastal zone of Peru (to 5 nm from shore) since 2001 (Regulation: DS-012-2001-PE) and manual beach seines from 2009 (Regulation: RM-112-2009-PRODUCE ). This has likely reduced the catch of inshore elasmobranchs in Peruvian coastal waters. The Galápagos Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos&#160;Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).

It inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries, all of which are intense and largely unmanaged across much of its range. Although it has always been rare, records have become increasingly so over the decades since the 1950s; it is thought to be locally extinct in the Gulf of California and is overfished further south. There were nine records from all of Mexico between 1978 and 1994 and there have been none since. The situation is somewhat different in Colombia, where the species persists and is caught relatively frequently in artisanal catches. Fishing pressure is high there and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction, although not as severe as that seen in Mexico. Overall, due to the known sensitivity of hammerhead sharks to overfishing, degradation of mangrove habitats, the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, and the lack of recent records in Mexico (a large proportion of its range) despite fisheries-dependent and -independent surveys, it is inferred that the Scalloped Bonnethead has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (24 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered

This species is threatened by artisanal fisheries exploitation for food and for use as bait in parts of its range in some central American countries. The Yellow Stingray is occasionally collected for use in personal aquariums. This species may also decline due to recovery of their predators such as the Goliath Grouper (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>) in Florida (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).,"There are two sources of population trend information: (1) a self-reported SCUBA diver data set&#160;from the&#160;Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REFF), and (2)&#160;the Global Finprint project, which is a global scale initiative to assess the spatial variation in status of sharks and rays on coral reefs. From 2015 to 2018, it sampled over 400 reefs as well as accessed legacy data from other research programs (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;Using data from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, a self-reported SCUBA divers data set, the Yellow Stingray was widely distributed throughout the greater-Caribbean from central Florida to northern South America, and from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico to the Antilles. In total, the Yellow Stingray was observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7% sighting frequency) out of nearly 84,000 surveys with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2007 with a standardized decline rate of 0.11% (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;Using data from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, a self-reported SCUBA diver dataset, sighting frequency declined by 70% decline in over 1.5 generation lengths. This dataset focusses on coral reefs, yet this species is distributed over a much broader range of habitats and hence the Global Finprint project analysis is more likely to encompass the wider range of habitats of this species and also avoid the heterogeneity of the volunteer and SCUBA-focussed REFF data.<br/><p></p><p>Spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 73.6% of the coral reefs within the Yellow Stingray’s known range from 2015 to 2018.

Reef level relative population estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted relative population level of Yellow Stingray was estimated as 109.7% (standard error 73.8–145.5%) and the 9.7% increase was assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (29 years) (see Supplementary Information).

It occurs over the continental shelf from inshore to 65 m depth. This ray is captured in artisanal gillnet fisheries, and demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries. Although hake fisheries are patchy across its range, gillnet fishing is intense and unmanaged throughout most of its range and shrimp trawling occurs in many areas. Some of these fisheries, such as the Gulf of California artisanal gillnet fishery, have driven declines in various pelagic marine species; others have been noted for overcapacity, poor governance, and declining catches. However, in the northern portion of its range, it is suspected that the population has been stable over the past 20–25 years. Further south though, it is suspected that the species is declining due to intense levels of generally unmanaged fishing pressure. Balancing these trends, combined with its limited biological productivity and some refuge (e.g. Galápagos&#160;Marine Reserve), it is suspected that the Pacific Cownose Ray&#160;has undergone a  population reduction of 20–29% <span class=""st"">over the past three generations (21 years), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).</span>","The Pacific Cownose Ray is benthopelagic over the continental shelf from inshore to 65 m depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 104 cm disc width (DW); females mature at 70–72 cm DW and males mature at 69–70 cm DW;&#160;reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with an annual reproductive cycle and females give birth to a single pup that is 38–43 cm DW after a gestation period of 10–12 months (Bizzarro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Burgos-Vázquez <em>et al.</em> 2019). Median age-at-maturity is 3.8 years and maximum age is 9.8 years (Burgos-Vázquez 2018), giving a generation length of 6.8 years.","The Pacific Cownose Ray is captured in artisanal gillnet fisheries, and demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries. In San Felipe, Baja California, Mexico, it makes up a large portion of the catch in the hake trawl fishery and may be overfished there (Godínez-Padilla and Castillo-Geniz 2016). It is one of the most common batoid species landed in artisanal fisheries in both the northern  Gulf of California and in Bahía Almejas, Baja California Sur, Mexico (Bizzarro <em>et al. </em>2007). These fisheries have caused notable declines in turtles, marine mammals, and pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). On the Mexican Pacific coast, including the Gulf of California, shrimp trawl fisheries declined from 1,552 boats in 1990 to 757 boats in 2017 (CONAPESCA 2017). Off <span>Mazatlán, the shrimp trawl fishery is noted for its overcapacity, poor governance, and declining catches (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Guatemala, this ray made up over 54% of the biomass of ray bycatch in the industrial demersal shrimp trawl fishery (Ixquiac-Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Costa Rica, it is caught in trawls and has a moderate susceptibility (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2018). Artisanal gillnet fisheries are increasing and unmanaged in areas further south, and there are inadequately managed trawl fisheries in Colombia and Ecuador that are likely to catch this species. Their aggregative behaviour may make them susceptible to being captured in large numbers at one time. Although this species is not very productive, catches are patchy and their continued relative abundance suggests they may be able to withstand some fishing pressure.","Catches of the Pacific Cownose Ray in Gulf of California artisanal fisheries were relatively stable between 1997 and 2010 and increased until 2014, likely due to a shift in fishing effort (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2016). On the western coast of Baja California, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was low between 2000 and 2010 (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al. </em>2013). In the northern portion of its range, it is suspected that the population has been stable over the past 20–25 years. Further south though, it is suspected that the species is declining due to intense levels of generally unmanaged fishing pressure. Overall, due to the level of intense unmanaged fishing pressure throughout much of its range, combined with its continued relative abundance in the northern part of its distribution, it is suspected that the Pacific Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generations (21 years).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Cownose Ray occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from northern Mexico to northern Peru, including the Gulf of California and the <span class=""st"">Galápagos Islands (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).<em><br/></em>",This ray is retained and the meat is salted for sale locally and is sometimes used as bait (Bizzarro <em>et al.</em> 2007).,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this ray.

Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous, and females give birth to 1–5 pups that are 40 cm DW after a gestation of 10–11 months (Villavicencio-Garayazar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994). Generation length (GL) is suspected to be about 28 years, based on data available for the closely-related but smaller Diamond Stingray (<em>Hypanus dipterurus</em>) which has a GL of 18.8 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2007, 2008).","The Longtail Stingray is captured in artisanal gillnets, purse seines, and longlines and in industrial shrimp trawl fisheries which are intense and unmanaged throughout most of its range. Artisanal gillnet fisheries are widespread in the Gulf of California, and they lack effective management and have been responsible for declines in elasmobranchs (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Trawl fisheries operate off Mazatlan and have been noted for their overcapacity, poor governance, and declines in catches (Foster and Vincent 2010). Longline fisheries targeting elasmobranchs began there prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). In Guatemala, this species is sought after in multispecies gillnet fisheries and is commonly caught. In Costa Rica, shrimp trawlers catch this species commonly and it is one of the top three most susceptible species to that fishery (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although released there, this species made up over 75% of ray catches and over 10% of the overall catch in one study of artisanal fisheries in Costa Rica (López-Garro and Zanella 2015). In Panama, this ray is caught as bycatch and targeted by longlines and artisanal gillnets close to shore (Rodriguez-Arriatti 2011). In addition, it is caught in the Gulf of Panama as bycatch in the artisanal purse seine fishery targeting small pelagic fish (Morales-Saldaña unpubl. data 2019). Artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries are present in Colombia and Ecuador, but management measures are insufficient. Data from landings of small and large-scale fisheries in the Colombian Pacific show a greater capture of juvenile individuals of this species (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2011). Although protections are in place in the Galápagos Islands, illegal fishing continues (Schiller <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is very little refuge from fishing within this species' range, and its large size and presumably late maturation make it highly sensitive to fishing pressure.","There is some evidence of declines of this species in Colombia from a short time-series. In Pacific Colombia,&#160;there was a decrease in the average catch size and in the relative abundance of the Longtail Stingray in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 2001 (150.6 cm TL and 0.27 individuals/hr) and 2007 (129.7 cm TL, and 0.09 individuals/hr; Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). This is a short time-series and caution is required in extrapolating that is a longer-term population reduction. The population is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its range, with little refuge. The life history characteristics of the Longtail Stingray are not conducive to it being able to withstand intense fishing pressure, therefore, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (84 years).",Decreasing,"The Longtail Stingray occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Magdalena Bay, Mexico, to Ecuador including the <span class=""st"">Galápagos Islands (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","This stingray is retained for its meat, which is consumed or sold locally.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this stingray.

There is a shrimp trawl fishery that likely interacts with this species  in the southern Gulf of California, and management  issues such as overcapacity and  declining catches have been cited in  that fishery (Foster and Vincent  2010). Artisanal gillnets are common further south in Mexico and do land this shark (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Costa Rica, it is caught by  pelagic and demersal longliners and has been recorded in the shrimp trawl fishery there (Campos 1986). Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' Central and South American  range. This species is recorded in landings in Ecuador (Estupiñán-Montaño <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Peru, pressure on inshore shark species is high,  particularly houndsharks, but it is likely that the Whitenose Shark is also a component of landings there. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","Landing records of Whitenose Shark&#160;from Gulf of California artisanal fisheries indicate a peak catch of about 500 t in 1969 and another smaller peak of over 300 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Catch was lower over the next several decades, remaining at about 100 t annually through the 1990s and early 2000s. At the end of the time-series, Whitenose Shark catches increased to around 200 t in 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Intense artisanal gillnet  pressure in the Gulf of California has led to declines in pelagic  sharks and other marine species (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Targeted fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were  already in operation in the early 1960s (Kato 1965). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, this species made up a small portion of the catch in artisanal fisheries, but was the fourth most captured shark between 1996 and 2003 (Soriano-Velásquez <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Guatemala in the 1990s, this species was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, representing about 12% of the catch.

This shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines throughout much of its range. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. There is evidence of a population reduction including an increasing rarity of landings and anecdotal evidence from fishers. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is high and has led to declines in pelagic sharks, and smaller coastal sharks are increasingly targeted without management (or inadequate enforcement of regulations). Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches in other species, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted.&#160;Throughout its Central and South American range, the species is subjected to intense fishing pressure. Recent landings surveys in Costa Rica have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that they were previously much more common.&#160;In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s.&#160;Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific. Although this species has a relativity high biological productivity, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California. Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, balanced with some areas of refuge, it is suspected that the Pacific Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark inhabits the continental shelf from the intertidal zone to 100 m (Amezcua-Linares 1996), and it may utilize mangroves as other sharpnose sharks tend to (Gallo <em>et al.</em> 2010).

Reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to litters of 2–5&#160;young that are 33–34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is suspected to be similar to that of the congeneric Atlantic Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon terranovae</em>) in the Gulf of Mexico at about 5 years (Carlson and Baremore 2003, Loefer and Sedberry 2003).","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.

Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Guatemala, this species is landed commonly with a peak in November that includes neonates (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Costa Rica and Colombia, shrimp trawl fisheries have declined to the point of being unprofitable, indicating overfishing. In a vulnerability analysis of elasmobranchs in the Costa Rica shrimp  trawl fishery, this species was determined to be highly vulnerable (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2018). These sharks are caught frequently on bottom longlines in Costa Rica. Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' South American  range, and there is little management in place. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks, have been degraded as a result of coastal development and shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/>Although this species is relatively productive and could probably withstand some fishing pressure, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability, and there is no refuge at depth. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California.","In the Gulf of California, this coastal shark was the second most important shark in artisanal landings between 1960 and 2014, with peaks of 3,000 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s and of over 2,000 t in the early 1990s. Since the mid-1990s landings have been between 1,000 and 2,000 t (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2017). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks in the 1960s, and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records from the northern Gulf of California hake fishery are rare. This shark is subjected to intense fishing pressure in Guatemala, and a population reduction is suspected there. In Costa Rica, recent landings surveys have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that the species was previously much more common.&#160;In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s (P.A.

This species is caught in artisanal gillnet and longline and industrial trawl fisheries across its range. Gillnetting in the Gulf of California has been extensive and has led to the decline of various marine species. Shrimp trawling is prevalent in the southern Gulf of California, and this species has also been targeted there in artisanal fisheries since at least the 1960s. In Mexico, records of this species were relatively common from the 1950s to the 1980s, it became increasingly rare through the 1990s and early 2000s, and the last confirmed record is from 2001. Further south, intense and increasing artisanal fishing exists with very little management in place. Relative abundance decreased in the Colombian industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 1995 and 2004, which represented the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations (27 years).&#160;However, this species is still recorded in Pacific Colombian artisanal fisheries but with less frequency than in the past. Given its shallow depth range, this species has very little refuge from fishing.

It reaches a maximum size of 140 cm total length (TL); size- and age-at-maturity are unknown, but males are approaching maturity at 100 cm TL (Castro 2011). Reproduction is placental viviparous, but little else is known of its biology.&#160;Generation length is suspected to be about 9 years, close to that of the similarly-sized and closely-related Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Lessa and Santana 1998).","Pacific Smalltail Sharks are caught in trawl and artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries. Gillnets that often target sharks are prevalent in the Gulf of California and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and other marine life (Sala <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is a shrimp trawl fishery that likely interacts with this species in the southern Gulf of California, and management  issues such as overcapacity and declining catches have been cited in  that fishery (Foster and Vincent 2010). Fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s when it was among the most abundant sharks in catches (Kato 1965, Kato and Hernández-Carvallo 1967 cited in Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Further south in this species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place. Given its shallow depth range, this shark likely has little refuge from fishing.","In Pacific Mexico, this species was relatively common in ichthyological collections until the 1980s. There were very few records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and there are no records since a 2001 fishing survey (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Targeted fisheries for sharks including this species off Mazatlan were in operation in the early 1960s, and this species was one of the most regularly caught sharks (Kato 1965, Kato and Hernández-Carvallo 1967 cited in Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Intense artisanal gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California has led to declines in pelagic sharks (Sala&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004), and there is intense trawl pressure in parts of Mexico. Intense and unregulated artisanal fishing pressure exists in the southern portion of its range but little species information is available except for Colombia.&#160;<br/><br/>In Pacific Colombia, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of Pacific Smalltail Shark in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 1995 (0.24 individuals/hour) and 2004 (0.02 individuals/hour) (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016), the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations (27 years). There was also a decrease in the average size of individuals caught from 41 cm total length (TL) in 1995 to 38 cm TL in 2004 (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016).

A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will  be required which will need to include species protection, spatial  management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest management, all of which  will be dependent on effective enforcement. Further research is needed  on life history, population size and trend, use and trade, and threats,  and both artisanal and commercial fisheries should be monitored for  bycatch at the species level.","",,false,false,Global

The species is predominantly insectivorous (Straight and Cooper 2012, Cleere and Kirwan 2018). It breeds generally from mid-April to July, although commencement of breeding varies according to location, with individuals in the south of the breeding range starting even in early March, whereas in the north of the range breeding may not start until mid-May (Cleere and Kirwan 2018).

These include habitat degradation due to urban development, and the species’s habit of utilising roads for dust baths <em>etc.</em> at night means it is at risk from collisions with cars (see Straight and Cooper 2012).

Chuck-will’s-widow is also very sensitive to disturbance (although this may just result in the moving of the nest rather than nest abandonment [see Straight and Cooper 2012]), and could be affected by pesticide use as it is insectivorous, and will feed over pasture (see Straight and Cooper 2012). It has also been suggested that changes in habitat may be bringing the species more into contact with competitors, such as Eastern Whip-poor-will. As the latter’s range alters it may potentially be causing indirect impacts on Chuck-will’s-widow, although there is little direct evidence for this currently (see Straight and Cooper 2012), and Eastern Whip-poor-will itself is thought to be declining moderately rapidly (Rosenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), so it is highly unclear whether this species is having any impact on Chuck-will's-widow, and as such is not coded as a threat here.","Partners in Flight (2019) estimated the global population of mature individuals at 5,700,000.",Decreasing,"<em>Antrostomus carolinensis</em>&#160;is a migratory species that is considered generally common, breeding in eastern <strong>U.S.A.</strong>,&#160;locally in southern <strong>Canada</strong>&#160;(extreme southern Ontario), and in the northern <strong>Bahamas </strong>(see Cleere and Kirwan 2018).

The species is partially migratory, with non-breeding birds dispersing to the south in the Caribbean and along the Pacific coast. <p></p>","Populations were heavily exploited for food in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and in Mexico, chicks are harvested and used as fishing bait (Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2018; Koczur <em>et al</em>. 2020). Today, fluctuations occur at some colonies, apparently relating to predators which can cause rapid declines; recoveries have been observed following predator control. Further threats to the species include habitat shifting and alteration from sea-level rise and subsidence, habitat degradation from recreational and commercial boating and shipping, disturbance from tourism and residential development, and coastal engineering (Wilson<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<p></p>","Recent estimates suggest that the majority of the population is found in Mexico and Texas, USA (C.

The species may also nest solitarily or as single pairs amidst colonies of Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradisaea</em> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). After breeding, the adults and juveniles depart the breeding grounds from late-July to August, migrating in flocks of up to a hundred individuals and spending the winter in small flocks or as solitary individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on coastal tundra wetlands in the Arctic, showing a preference for swampy, moss and sedge tundra with many lakes, floodlands and low-lying shallow brackish pools, especially where these contain islets or narrow peninsulas of grass or moss and have low, moist margins that provide feeding areas (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species is pelagic, occurring in cold water upwelling zones south of the Equator (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> When breeding, its diet consists of adult and larval insects (e.g. springtails Collembola), arachnids, small fish and carrion, as well as small birds and the eggs of Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradisaea</em> and conspecifics (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species also takes seeds and plant matter on its arrival to the breeding grounds before the Arctic ice melts and other prey items become available (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding </em>Outside of the breeding season the species takes marine invertebrates and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape or more substantial cup of grass, moss, seaweed and feathers placed on rocky, barren or damp ground vegetated with moss or grass, usually near the edge of water (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","No specific information on threats to this species has been recorded within Europe, however as an Arctic breeding species, it is likely to be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including habitat change and ecosystem shifts (Ganter and Gaston 2013).

Remnant subpopulations in Costa Rica's Central Valley typically occur in riparian areas near heavily polluted streams, shade-grown coffee plantations and gardens. It can also be found in&#160;artificial water&#160;resources, such as water tanks, ponds, and drains (Hoffmann 2005).&#160;While the species tolerates some habitat disturbance, it appears to rely on isolated green spaces within the urban landscape of the Central Valley in Costa Rica&#160;(V. Acosta pers. comm. 2013).&#160;It typically breeds at ponds where eggs are oviposited on vegetation overhanging the water.","Despite this species' apparent tolerance to habitat degradation, it is nonetheless subject to factors that have caused amphibian fauna to decline in certain areas throughout Central America, in particular the fungal disease, chytridiomycosis.&#160;This species appears to have undergone rapid, dramatic declines across Costa Rica during the 1980s, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane species across Mesoamerica.&#160;Climate change or the synergistic effects of multiple factors could have played an additional role in the declines (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019). Chytrid has been found in individuals in at least three sites in the Central Valley; however the species continues to persist there (Whitfield&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, J. Cossel pers. comm.

It feeds on small fish and squid, with prey species and the proportion of each depending on the locality. It often feeds by hover-dipping and contact-dipping. Kleptoparasitism has been observed, and it will associate with other seabirds over schools of predatory fish. Its breeding season varies depending upon locality, with variable colony sizes and nest sites (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).","This species is harvested for food in Micronesia and Tokelau (Szabo 2013), although this is not thought to cause significant declines. House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>&#160;and cats <em>Felis catus&#160;</em>are thought to have been responsible for the extirpation of Black Noddy from Raoul Island (Szabo 2013) and remain a problem in the main Hawai’ian islands (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005) and likely much of the rest of the Noddy’s range. Invasive herbivores pose a threat through denudation of vegetation, with goats likely responsible for its extirpation on Malden Island (Gochfeld <em>et al</em>. 2018). The denudation of Phillip Island by goats, before they died out in the early 1900s, and subsequent prevention of regrowth by rabbits, before their eradication in 1988, is likely to have contributed to their historical decline on this island (Priddel <em>et al</em>. 2010). Increased sea-surface temperatures (SST) have been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate at studied colonies along the Great Barrier Reef, and above a particular temperature threshold, reproductive success has been recorded to be zero (Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2011). At present this impact appears restricted to a minority of the breeding population, and colonies have become established at new locations which may be related to adaption to climate impacts.","The global population is estimated to number 1,300,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Decreasing,"Black Noddy has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical seas, with colonies widespread in the western and central Pacific Ocean and more scattered across the Caribbean, central Atlantic and in the northeast Indian Ocean (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).",,Terrestrial|Marine,,Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The timing of breeding varies throughout the species's range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It may breed colonially in groups numbering up to 100,000 or more pairs, although it also nests almost solitarily depending on the availability of nesting sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). Even when not breeding the species remains gregarious and can occur in huge flocks in some areas, although it is more usually observed in smaller flocks of 50-100 individuals (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> The species occurs around isolated, bare or vegetated, pantropical and subtropical, inshore or oceanic islands or coral reefs with rocky cliffs or offshore stacks and coral or sand beaches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). It forages in the inshore waters surrounding such islands, often along the line of breakers or in lagoons, and disperses up to 50 km out into the pelagic zone to forage (especially when not breeding) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). Out at sea it often rests on buoys, flotsam, ships and on the open water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of small fish as well as squid, pelagic molluscs, medusae and insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest may be a simple layer of debris or a more elaborate construction of seaweed and sticks, and may be placed in a number of sites including flat shingle beaches, bare ground, cliff ledges, offshore stacks, low bushes and tall trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It nests in colonies that can be very dense or more open depending on the availability of nesting sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","House Rats <em>Rattus rattus&#160;</em>have caused declines in the Brown Noddy population on Dry Tortugas, US, and are thought to restrict the distribution on Ascension Island (Ascension Island Government 2015), and likely at other locations throughout the very large breeding range.

At most colonies, adults leave for the open sea after breeding and become strongly pelagic for 2-3 months before returning to the breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). On returning to the breeding colonies, they continue to forage pelagically by day and settle on land at night for a further 2-3 months before beginning to breed (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The timing of breeding varies throughout the species's range, with nesting occurring all year round at some colony sites, but seasonally at others (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species nests in very large colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and remains gregarious throughout the year (congregating in small to large flocks to feed at sea), although it may be observed singly (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> It breeds on flat, open, sparsely or heavily vegetated, oceanic or barrier islands of sand, coral or rock in productive tropical and subtropical offshore waters rich in plankton, fish and squid (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is absent from cold current areas and generally avoids islands with terrestrial predators (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species is highly pelagic, but generally avoids cold current areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <br/><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish up to 18 cm long (usually 6-8 cm) and squid, but it also occasionally takes crustaceans, insects and offal (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species is reliant upon prey driven to the surface by predatory fish (e.g. tuna, Scombidae), especially when breeding (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a slight depression or scrape on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). It shows a preference for nesting on flat, bare sand, coral grit or shell amongst low vegetation on beaches above the high-water mark or on coral islands, atolls and sandbanks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). Less often, it may nest on rock stacks or other offshore islets, and on ledges or terraces of cliffs (although it avoids sheer cliff-faces) (Higgins and Davies 1996). It nests in dense colonies, within which neighbouring nests may be placed c.50 cm apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Higher nesting densities occur in areas where bare ground predominates but which are vegetated with plants greater than or equal to 15 cm tall (Feare <em>et al.</em> 1997).","<p>Some colonies (e.g. Ascension Island) (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996) are threatened by predation from introduced rats <em>Rattus </em>spp. and domestic cats <em>Felis catus</em> (Rodriguez <em>et al.</em> 2006), and the species has been displaced from nesting colonies on Bird Island by invasive ants <em>Anoplolepis longipes</em> (Feare 1999). Colonies have declined in line with observed increases in sea temperatures in Australia, in contrast to the fortunes of Bridled Tern, which have formed new colonies further south (Dunlop and Surman 2012). Variations in sea-surface temperature have been shown to negatively influence the species's foraging success at breeding colonies, hence lowering reproductive success (Erwin and Congdon 2007). Previously, persistent large scale egg-collecting in some areas has encouraged the species to move to suboptimal nesting sites, resulting in higher mortality and reduced reproductive success (van Halewyn and Norton 1984).</p><p></p>","The global   population is estimated to number c.35 million individuals   (Wetlands International 2020), which roughly equates to 23 million mature individuals.",Unknown,Sooty Tern breeds on tropical islands and ranges through most of the tropical oceans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).,,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong></strong><br/>The mortality of the species was  significantly reduced on Isla Isabel (a densely forested tropical  island off the Pacific coast of Mexico) by the eradication of introduced  domestic cats <em>Felis catus</em> using a combination of poisoning, trapping and hunting with firearms (Rodriguez <em>et al.</em>  2006).

Low cost of flight due to extensive use of thermals allows exploitation of tropical waters in which prey is scarce (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 2003). It feeds mainly on flying-fish and squid, but also jellyfish, baby turtles, seabird eggs and chicks, offal and fish scraps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","Hunting likely occurs at numerous breeding sites, causing slow but significant population declines.

Breeding pairs typically produce 1-2 chicks per breeding season (Macaw Recovery Network 2019). In south-western Ecuador, it breeds in June-November, and nests in cavities of dead <em>Cavanillesia plantanifolia</em> trees (Berg and Horstman 1996; López-Lanús <em>et al</em>. 1999). Orchids made up 71% of the diet of a pair watched in Ecuador, and their feeding range was estimated at 2,000 ha (López-Lanús <em>et al</em>. 1999).

It occurs from the surface down to depths of at least 330 m. The species exhibits moderately slow life history characteristics. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth. and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 250 reefs in 39 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 48.8% over three generation lengths (37 years). Therefore, the Whitetip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (37 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Whitetip Reef Shark is demersal on the continental shelves and around oceanic islands and reefs at depths of 0–330 m (Randall 1977). It is closely associated with coral reefs in clear tropical waters (Compagno 1984). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) but adults are very rare over 160 cm. Size-at-maturity is about 105 cm TL (Randall 1977). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta, small litters of 1–5 (Last and Stevens 2009), an annual reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 52–60 cm TL. Growth is slow in the wild, estimated at 2.1–4.2 cm year<sup>-1</sup> (Randall 1977), and they may attain sexual maturity at eight to nine years and live to about 16 years (Randall 1977, Smith <em>et al.</em> 1998). Generation length is estimated to be 12.3 years (Randall 1977).","<p>The Whitetip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al.</em> 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.</p><p>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.&#160;Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.</p><p>&#160;</p>","Genetic studies support multiple subpopulations of Whitetip Reef Sharks, with the clearest separation between the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Whitney<em> et al</em>. 2012). There is also evidence that there is population structure in the Pacific Ocean, possibly drive by isolation by distance (Whitney <em>et al.</em> 2012). For example, samples from the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef showed differentiation. Samples from the Eastern Pacific (Costa Rica) have low genetic diversity (a single mitochondrial haplotype) but are genetically similar to those from the Central Pacific.&#160;<br/><br/>There are numerous reports of declines in reef shark populations throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans (e.g. MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020; Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010), but few specific to Whitetip Reef Sharks. Robbins <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported ongoing collapse on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), with an estimated decline of 80% on reefs with the fewest fishing restrictions based on diver surveys. Later research using baited remote underwater video (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014) and fishing surveys (Heupel <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggest the declines were less dramatic than reported by Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006), and that increases in unfished areas of the GBR had resulted in some recovery. Nadon&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2012), using towed diver surveys, showed that reef shark populations, including Whitetip Reef Sharks, were at carrying capacity on reefs uninhabited by humans, but had declined to very low levels (&lt;3% of carrying capacity) on inhabited islands (e.g. main Hawaiian Islands, Guam). In the areas with large declines, the relative importance of Whitetip Reef Sharks on reefs had increased relative to other reef shark species.&#160;Given the population structure observed in Whitetip Reef Sharks it is difficult to assess the global status of this species from patchy accounts of possible declines in some parts of its range.&#160;<br/><br/>To account for differences in the trajectory of Whitetip Reef Shark subpopulations among locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). This is the largest data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Whitetip Reef Sharks was estimated as 48.8% (standard error 39.8–57.7%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (~37 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded that the Whitetip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in the last 3 generation lengths (~37 years) and is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.",Decreasing,"The Whitetip Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean from western Africa to the Eastern Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Whitney <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<em><br/></em>","The meat of this species is sold fresh, frozen, salted and dried for human consumption at local markets throughout it range. The fins are retained, and Fields <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported that this species made up 0.04% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. Skins, teeth, and liver are also retained at times.",Marine,"There are few species-specific conservation measures in place. Queensland, Australia has a trip limit of one in place for commercial and recreational fishers. Some countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Palau, French Polynesia, Cook Islands). However, incidental catches frequently occur in artisanal fisheries that are often exempt from these rules. However, there are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species. Marine Protected Areas that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2020). MPAs are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It exhibits an ontogenetic shift from feeding primarily on shrimps and other crustaceans towards small fishes (Engraulidae, Clupeidae) (Keith et al. 2000, Winemiller et al. 2011, Moreno-Sanchez et al. 2015). Maximum reported size is 36.2 cm TL (IGFA 2001) and 1.025 kg (Cervigon 1992). This species is capable of persisting across a wide salinity gradient (Suarez-Bautista and Rodriguez-Forero 2015).","<p>The primarily threats to this species result from coastal development and anthropogenic inputs into coastal waters. However, the range-wide effect of these stressors have not been quantitatively evaluated. Localized coastal development and mangrove destruction has the potential to reduce suitable habitat. Intensive shrimp aquaculture in coastal areas may lead to destruction of mangrove habitat, and increase nutrient loading in adjacent lagoons (Alonso-Perez et al. 2003, Ortiz-Lozano et al. 2005). In Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama, coastal mangrove forests are threatened by the expansion of aquaculture infrastructure, coastal development, and exploitation for firewood and charcoal production (Recio et al. 2016). Localized river regulation, watershed development, contamination, and the impacts of introduced species have the potential to degrade habitat quality in Puerto Rico (Neal et al. 2009). Similarly, habitat quality in the Patuca River may be threatened by flow regulations (Esselman and Opperman 2010).&#160;The impacts of established invasive species are unknown, but may reduce suitable habitat and prey availability at certain localities such as Lake Gatun (Sharpe et al. 2017).</p>","<p>The total population size and range-wide population trend of <em>C. ensiferus</em> are unknown. </p>  <p>Localized population trend in Puerto Rico is likely declining (Smith et al. 2008) as a result of river regulation, watershed development, contamination, and the impacts of introduced species (Neal et al. 2009). </p>  <p>This species is widely distributed, but relatively uncommon where it occurs (H.

This species is still present in Lake Gatun at low abundances, despite potential competitive interactions with the established <em>Cichla monoculus</em> (Sharpe et al. 2017). Catch statistics for this species are often unavailable because they may also include <em>Centropomus parallelus </em>(FAO 2003).

Within this broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. The species has a conservative life history, producing only one pup on average every 1–3 years and likely has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. The Spinetail Devil Ray is a large component of targeted fisheries and a bycatch of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated as <em>Mobula </em>species. The depths and regions used by the Spinetail Devil Ray coincide with many artisanal and industrial fisheries raising concerns about previously unreported and continued bycatch. Steep population declines are evident in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including India and Indonesia. The lack of species-specific catch records, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess some population reductions, however notable declines in landings of 50–96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. The Spinetail Devil Ray has a widespread global range and in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and strong fisheries management. The Spinetail Devil Ray is used locally and sometimes nationally, and often traded internationally, with the rise of the valuable gill plate trade increasing pressure on the species. Unlike for some of the other mobulid species, the development of localized marine protected areas is unlikely to provide this species any significant protection from fisheries due to its large-scale movements.&#160;Based on actual levels of exploitation, steep declining population trends, a conservative life history, and the increasing trade demand, a global population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years) is suspected, with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056). The Spinetail Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Endangered (A2bd+3d).</p></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>  </p><p>The Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is a pelagic species that resides in coastal and continental shelf waters.

The species exhibits large-scale movements, up to 1,800 km at minimum speeds of 63 km per day likely driven by seasonal patterns in prey availability  (Freund <em>et al. </em>2000, Canese <em>et al.</em> 2011, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2012, Francis and Jones 2017). <span lang=""en-GB"">The species reaches a maximum size of 350 cm DW (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020), with significant geographical variation in size across its  distribution.

These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines.

Despite a broad worldwide distribution, populations appear to be patchily distributed. Abundance also appears to vary substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they have been, or are currently being, fished. Like many mobulid species, the Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is often solitary but may aggregate in large numbers to feed or reproduce. Abundance estimates have been attempted with aerial surveys in some areas like the northwest Mediterranean Sea, where a population of up to 12,700 individuals was estimated (Fortuna <em>et al</em>. 2014, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the population trend is unknown, but it is suspected to be decreasing.<br/><br/>In India, population reductions are suspected based on declines in devilray catches, while effort has increased in several regions, including Kerala, along the Tuticorin coast, and Mumbai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012). Landings data from trawlers operating out of Mumbai revealed maximum landings of 6.3 tonnes (t) for '<em>M. diabolus</em>' (an invalid name, possibly referring at least in part to the Spinetail Devil Ray) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which time fishing effort almost doubled. From this decline in catch and increase in effort, local population declines can be inferred. Such declines are unquantifiable to species-level given the potential grouping of several species under one synonym and the difficulty of identification. In Sri Lanka, fishermen have reported declines in mobulid catches over the past 5 to 10 years as targeted fishing pressure has increased (Fernando and Stevens 2011). Data collected since 2011 shows a steady decline in both 2013 and 2014, although fishing pressure has either remained stable or increased (D. Fernando unpubl. data). Overall, the rate of population reduction of devilrays appears to be high in the region. The scale and effects of devilray fisheries in Sri Lanka and India suggest considerable population reduction regionally (Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, mobulids have been increasingly targeted in many countries, most notably the Philippines and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula </em>spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;declined by 96% in Tanjung Luar, and by 50% in Cilacap (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Spinetail Devil Ray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Intense, directed fisheries (over 22 active fishery sites) for mobulid species have existed in the Philippines, particularly the Sulu Sea, for over a century with steep historical declines suspected based on fishing effort and landings data (Alava 2002, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). As in Indonesia, depletion is suspected in areas, although targeted fishing continues in some locations (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Throughout most of its range, populations of the Spinetail Devil Ray appear to be in decline, due to directed fishing and incidental capture as bycatch. Declines can be inferred in many regions based on declines in landings or sightings concurrent with increasing effort (Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Regional extinction is suspected in areas with intense and increasing fishing pressure (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). In some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and in the former two countries, strong fisheries management. Globally, based on current levels of exploitation and declining population trends, the suspected population reduction is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056).",Decreasing,"<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>The Spinetail Devil Ray is circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters throughout all oceans. Notably, it is present in the Mediterranean Sea but absent in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017) and its occurrence is patchy throughout its distribution (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).

The meat from mobulids is often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles). Mobulids including the Spinetail Devil Ray are used in aquarium display  tanks, e.g. in some Gulf countries (R.

Implementation, however, has been slow. This species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks and a special suite of 'Concerted Actions' (based on the IUCN Species Survival Commission Shark Specialist Group's (SSG) Global Devil and Manta Ray Conservation Strategy; see Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017), which are aimed at facilitating conservation. <em>Mobula</em> species were listed on Appendix II of CITES in 2016, which requires CITES Parties to provide a non-detriment finding to determine whether trade of <em>Mobula</em> products is sustainable.</p>  <p>This species is included among 24 elasmobranch species listed in 2001 on Annex II (Endangered or Threatened Species) of the Barcelona Convention Protocol concerning Special Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for these species. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been slow. </p>  <p>In 2015, IATTC prohibited <em>Mobula </em>species caught by large-scale fisheries in the IATTC Convention Area from being retained, sold, etc., and mandated prompt, careful release; exceptions for small-scale Eastern Pacific fisheries are meant to allow only domestic consumption. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) added <em>Mobula</em> species to their 'key shark species' list (for assessment only) in 2016 and adopted safe release guidelines in 2017. Proposals to ban retention of <em>Mobula</em> species under the WCPFC and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) have been unsuccessful to date.</p>  <p>On national and local scales, 'Manta' rays tend to be subject to more protections than devilrays.<br/></p>  <p>To allow recovery, it is recommended that mobulid landings be prohibited, in line with several international agreements, at least as long as the global populations are threatened. Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, protocols for safe release, and codes of conduct for responsible tourism are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.

Velarde<em> in litt.</em> 1998, Velarde 1999). During strong El Niño years breeding success collapses to near zero, in comparison to around 0.5 in a typical year, and individual female mass is greatly reduced (Case <em>et al.</em> 2002). Ocean warming events and high sea surface temperature (SST) conditions greatly impact population growth rates in <em>Larus heermanni</em>. Under stable, normal SST conditions, population growth is estimated at ~4% however under high SST conditions, anomalously warm temperatures can result in a decline in population growth of up to 15%. Whilst the species can resist oceanographic anomalies of up to 1 event every 5 years without compromising population growth rates, the increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST conditions will likely facilitate increasingly rapid and severe population declines in the decades to come (Velarde and Ezcurra 2018).</p><p>About 90% of the global population exists on Isla Rasa, a basalt platform of 0.68 km2 and, as such, the occupied breeding range is very small. However, Isla Rasa was declared a sanctuary in 1964 (Anderson <em>et al. </em>1976), and has been well-managed during the breeding season by resident biologists, who discourage egg-collecting and disturbance (E. Velarde <em>in litt</em>. 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Commercial egg collection prior to the declaration of Isla Rasa as a sanctuary considerably reduced the population (Bowen <em>et al. </em>2015).

Previously, Elegant Terns have shown high fidelity to breeding on Isla Rasa, with 90% of the population breeding on this island prior to 2000, even in adverse years. More recently there has been no successful nesting on Isla Rasa in 2003, 2009, 2010 or 2014 with each of these years being preceded by seasons of particularly high fishing effort. Warm sea surface temperature anomalies are thought to be the main factor determining the proportion of the tern population nesting away from Isla Rasa and the surrounding region, but fishing effort and total landings during the previous year also have a significant impact (Velarde <em>et al. </em>2015). Currently, when the sea surface temperature anomaly around Isla Rasa is over 1°C, more than 70% of total Elegant tern nesting population is observed in three Californian colonies, especially in San Diego, compared to less than 20% in years with a sea surface temperature anomaly of less than 1°C (Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2015).

(2012) found that the relationship between reproductive success and habitat conditions varies across the breeding range.<br/><br/>In winter, it occurs predominantly in pine-oak forested habitats in mixed-species flocks, foraging at sites with a high density of ""encino"" oaks (in comparison to pines and other oak species) at 1,100-3,000 m (Vidal <em>et al. </em>1994, Thompson 1995, Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2000, King <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012) and oaks appear to be essential in the wintering habitat (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). It was thought to have a wider winter habitat tolerance (and may be tolerant of moderate levels of logging and grazing [Rappole <em>et al</em>. 1999]<strong></strong>), but this requires substantiation (J. Sterling <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Breeding habitat is subject to clearing for land development and agriculture (Ladd and Gass 1999), leading to increased habitat fragmentation, which can&#160;impair gene flow (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008; Athrey <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011),&#160;and increase nest predation and brood parasitism (Pulich 1976, Peak 2007, Reidy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009b, Sperry <em>et al. </em>2009); thus reducing productivity (Peak and Thompson 2014). Long-term changes in this species's habitat have been documented (Heger 2012, Heger and Hayes in prep.), such that (based on only a portion of the range) potentially 23% of suitable breeding habitat was lost between 1993-94 and 2004-05 and 33% lost from 2004-05 to 2016. Duarte <em>et al. </em>(2013) additionally found a 29% reduction in total breeding habitat between 1999-2001 and 2010-11.&#160;Moreover, both Duarte <em>et al</em>. (2016a) and Diamond <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that lost habitat was unlikely to regenerate after a habitat patch was cleared. The 2011 drought and 2015 floods have potentially had an additional impact on habitat loss (Heger and Hayes in prep<em>.,&#160;</em>Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests <em>in litt. </em>2018), though these will have been incorporated as part of the Heger and Hayes (in prep) analyses. The 2011 drought also reinforced efforts to try to eradicate Ashe junipers (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;Importantly, habitat loss and fragmentation can lead to reduced connectivity across habitat patches and connectivity has been found to be essential to maintain species viability at both the local (Duarte et al. 2016b) and range-wide scale (Duarte <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><br/>The decline may also be being driven by forest fires, logging and firewood-extraction, and agricultural conversion for cattle reducing pine-oak habitats in its wintering range (Ladd and Gass 1999,&#160;Rappole <em>et al</em>. 2003a, J. Lyons&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018)<strong></strong>. Millions of hectares of forest burned between 1998 and 2016, which is equivalent to 33% of total area of the ecoregion (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). It is thought that suitable wintering habitat may be considerably more limited than that available in the breeding range with wintering habitat able to support just 15% of the population that could be supported by breeding habitat (Rappole <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Forest loss throughout this species's entire range is currently estimated at ~3.6% across a ten year period (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). An infestation of Southern Pine Beetle (<em>Dendroctonus frontalis</em>) since 2015, particularly in Honduras, has had a significant impact on forests in the wintering range, increasing the risk of catastrophic fires (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>A range of other factors could also have an influence on the species and its habitat. Predation of incubating females by rat snakes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Elaphe </span>spp.) (and potentially other nest predators [C. Harper <em>in litt. </em>2016]) appears to be an important contributor to adult mortality, accounting for perhaps 15% of breeding female deaths (Reidy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a). White-tailed Deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>), invasive Wild Boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), invasive plants and oak wilt fungus (<em>Ceratocystis fagacearum</em>) and increasing wildfire risk may all impact the habitat (Russell and Fowler 1999, Juzwik <em>et al. </em>2008, USFWS 2014), while Tawny Crazy Ant&#160;(<em>Nylanderia fulva</em>)&#160;is expanding its range into central Texas, so could be a potential threat (LeBrun <em>et al. </em>2013, Kumar <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;Adult mortality from vehicle and window strikes has also been reported (Reidy <em>et al.</em> 2018). Increasing anthropogenic noise, particularly via road construction, has also been considered as a threat however, recent studies have not evidenced any effect from such changes on the species (Lackey <em>et al</em>. 2011; Long <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Climate change is also thought to have significant impacts on the species, as its Ashe juniper dominated woodlands are likely to be unable to shift with shifting climate in the breeding range (EPA 2009), and some tree species in the non-breeding range may contract their range by 50% by 2050 (Goméz-Mendoza and Arriaga 2007). A petition in the state of Texas is also currently attempting to have the species's Endangered species status removed, significantly threatening the habitat in which it resides (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020).<p></p>","There is&#160;currently only one range-wide estimate of abundance for the species (Mathewson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mathewson <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted point count surveys in a subset of randomly selected habitat patches (301 patches total) across the breeding range in 2008–2009 and found density was most related to the predicted patch-specific occupancy probability based on the work of Collier <em>et al</em>. (2012). They estimated range-wide abundance for male birds to be ca. 262,013 (95% CI: 223,131 – 302,620). Using the density estimates of Mathewson <em>et al</em>. (2012), Hatfield<em> et al</em>.

A vast range of studies have attempted to estimate the amount of available habitat there is for the species (<em>per&#160;</em>Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2018; Pulich 1976; Wahl <em>et al. </em>1990; DeBoer and Diamond 2006; SWCA 2007; Diamond 2007; Loomis Austin 2008; Morrison <em>et al. </em>2010; Collier <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012; Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2012; Matthewson <em>et al. </em>2012; Duarte <em>et al. </em>2013, 2016a; Diamond <em>et al. </em>2016; Heger and Hayes <em>in prep.</em>).&#160;Collier <em>et al</em>. (2012) and Duarte <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated potential range-wide breeding habitat to be 16,787 km<sup>2</sup> and 15,783 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Notably, Collier <em>et al</em>. 2012 used repeated detection/non-detection surveys and spatial occupancy models to account for imperfect detection when estimating patch-specific occupancy probabilities. They estimated that 6,299 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of their delineated potential breeding habitat had an occupancy probability of &gt;0.9 and 11,243 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of their delineated potential breeding habitat had an occupancy probability of &gt;0.5. Recently,&#160;Heger and Hayes (in prep.) estimated that in 2016, there was c.4,560 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;available breeding habitat however, this is likely to be an overestimate and&#160;the Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests <em>in litt. </em>(2018) have estimated the Area of Occupancy during the breeding season to be 1,768 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>It winters mainly in the mountainous Pine-Oak ecoregion of Central America, from southern <strong>Mexico</strong> (Chiapas), <strong>Guatemala</strong>, <strong>El Salvador</strong>, <strong>Nicaragua</strong>, and <strong>Honduras</strong>, where it is uncommon to fairly common (Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole <em>et al</em>. 2000, Jones and Komar 2007, King <em>et al</em>. 2008)<strong></strong>. There are recent reports/records from <strong>Costa Rica </strong>(Garigues 2002) and <strong>Panama </strong>(Jones and Komar 2006)<strong></strong>. There is no consensus on the extent of suitable habitat within the species's wintering range, and its ecological integrity has not been established as to assess the conditions required to maintain optimal wintering populations (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica <em>in litt. </em>2018).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Within the breeding range, federal lands that provide long-term protection include Department of Defense lands (U.S. Army Fort Hood, U.S. Air Force Joint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) and Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Lower Colorado River Authority, The Nature Conservancy, and other cities, counties, and conservation organizations also own lands within the breeding range. Land management practices vary, but many of these lands are managed compatibly for this species (Groce<em> et al.</em> 2010, USFWS 2014).&#160;In the USA, it is listed on the Federal Endangered species list and has a recovery plan (USFWS 1992, Ladd and Gass 1999), although there is ongoing action within the state of Texas, despite the efforts of the USFWS, to have such Endangered species status removed (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020). Several regional habitat conservation plans have been approved or are under development (Ladd and Gass 1999, J. Lyons <em>in litt.</em> 1999), including the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve in western Travis County (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). Control of invasive species is being attempted in the breeding range, e.g. in Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (W. Reiner and J. Scalise&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). Efforts to protect the wintering range include the Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica, which was formed in 2003, and consists of institutions located in the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Alliance (2008) developed a conservation plan for the ecoregion with the goal of conserving pine-oak forest habitat. This conservation plan represents the first regional management, conservation, and sustainable development effort for pine-oak forests with the purpose of promoting and sustaining biodiversity, water, timber, recreation, and sustainable rural development (USFWS 2014).<br/>Since the species was listed on the Federal Endangered species list, habitat mapping, population monitoring, and viability analyses have increased our knowledge of species distribution, habitat requirements, and threats within the breeding range (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). In 2017, the Department of Defense and USFWS initiated efforts to track movements between the breeding and wintering range using geolocators (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Surveys in 2006-10 and 2014-8 have improved knowledge of its wintering distribution and trends (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). Several Private Conservation Banks have been established to protect habitat for the species.<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Provide permanent protection of large blocks of breeding habitat (USFWS 2014, Duarte <em>et al.</em> 2016a, C.

Population declines have been rapid in the past, but the rates of illegal capture appears to be slowing down in recent years, at least in parts of its range. The species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","The species occupies lowland and hill forest and woodland up to 1,500 m, and is also found in savanna and dry thorn scrub (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2020). Is seems to be able to adapt to deforested areas like pastures, plantations and even urban areas (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is closely associated with termites (e.g. <em>Euthermes nigriceps</em>) and uses arboreal termite nests for breeding (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The most severe threat to the species is trapping for the pet trade, which has led to local extirpations (Cantú <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. Cantú Guzmán <em>per </em>R. Low <em>in litt</em>. 2017, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). In general, trapping for the pet trade is a severe risk for parrot species; it constitutes one of the principal threats to Neotropical parrots and can lead to drastic population declines (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Mexico, parrot trade was banned in 2008, but before then the species was trapped legally (Cantú <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Between 1998 and 2008, over 8,000 individuals were legally captured, making it the second-most captured parrot species in Mexico (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Since the ban in 2008, illegal capturing is still ongoing in Mexico, albeit decreasing in recent years (Cantú <em>et al</em>. 2007, J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Trapping has also been recorded in Costa Rica and El Salvador (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).

For these reasons the species is  evaluated as Least Concern.","The species breeds in swamps, bogs and fens ranging from western Alaska eastward to Newfoundland (Tuck 1972, Arnold 1994). The population along the U.S. Pacific coast is resident, while populations elsewhere migrate to non-breeding grounds in southern U.S.A. and northern South America. Individuals begin departing the breeding grounds in late summer, with males preceding females by up to one month (Whitehead 1965, Tuck 1972). Spring migration peaks during late March, but may begin as early as late February or early March (Tuck 1972). The species forages in soft mud by probing for invertebrates and plant material (Tuck 1972). The species requires habitats composed of moist soils with an interspersion of soil and shallow water (Rundle 1981). It prefers habitats with short vegetation, including agricultural fields and pastures, but is less common on open mudflats or continuous areas of open water (Tuck 1972, Rundle 1981, Long &amp; Ralph 2001). Lack of rainfall can decrease the habitat quality for the species (Arnold 1994). On the non-breeding grounds, factors like changing water levels across a  region (e.g. coastal habitats, inland habitats), temperature,  agricultural practices and other anthropogenic factors contribute to  changing numbers at various locations (Robbins 1952, Carroll 2011).","The most severe threat to the species is the continuing loss and degradation of wetlands throughout the range (American Bird Conservancy 2018).
